1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,571
Previously on "Vikings":

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,871
We shall ask the gods
why do they make me earl,

3
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:07,742
yet kill my son?

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,333
- We can have more sons.
- Have we not tried?

5
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:13,238
Fill me with seed
before it's too late.

6
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,094
If you really want
to be a great man,

7
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:17,213
should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?

8
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:18,366
That's where your brother is.

9
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:21,013
He's already boasting
how he sailed west alone.

10
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:24,011
But you weren't invited.
You didn't even know about it.

11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,916
There is a Jarl
in Gotaland, Jarl Borg.

12
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:30,500
He continues to claim he has legal
rights over some of my land.

13
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,151
And now, once again,
he's making threatening noises.

14
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,646
How can I be of help?

15
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,128
Travel to Gotaland
as my emissary?

16
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:39,393
I shall be forever
in your debt.

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,988
Please stay.

18
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:46,204
Lord of lords,
who will bear me my son?

28
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,324
Send a rider tonight
and he'll be back by morning.

29
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,863
Why don't they let us
dry ourselves and get warm?

30
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:21,455
If I stay like this,
I will rust.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,554
What kind of
fellow is this Jarl Borg?

32
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,768
This is no way to treat guests,

33
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:28,219
whoever they are.

34
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:31,103
Especially if they've
been traveling for days on end.

35
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:52,943
Are you the
emissaries from King Horik?

36
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:57,533
Well, I can tell you at once you're
wasting your time. It's my land--

37
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,539
and I want it returned to me.

38
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,392
That's all I have to say.

39
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,502
He wants to make peace with you

40
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,952
and come to some kind of

41
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,345
agreement.

42
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:10,584
Then tell him if he leaves
my land, we can have peace.

43
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,888
But not before.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,194
How can you make peace,
Jarl Borg,

45
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,676
if you insist on
humiliating him?

46
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,824
If I invade and defeat him,

47
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,853
will he not be
even more humiliated?

48
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,082
Not if he fights well.

49
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,495
In any case,

50
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,643
I am sure that
he would relish a fight.

51
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:51,665
What's your name?

52
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,856
Ragnar Lothbrok.

53
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,636
You are Ragnar Lothbrok,

54
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,198
the one who sailed west?

55
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:04,524
I am surprised that
you've heard about that.

56
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,504
How are you surprised?

57
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,647
Everyone has heard
of your exploits.

58
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,943
Why have we not offered our
guests dry clothes and food?

59
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,240
Treat these folk well.

60
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:28,897
Give them ale, let them
dry out, feed them.

61
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,934
Tomorrow,
you and I will talk again,

62
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,819
Ragnar Lothbrok.

63
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:00,417
You haven't
eaten in three days.

64
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:15,920
You see?

65
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:20,959
I have fears.

66
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:26,992
Go to the Seer,

67
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,521
ask if your fears
will come true.

68
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,531
It's sometimes better
not to know one's fate.

69
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,748
I take it, from
what you said yesterday,

70
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,478
that King Horik is
prepared to compromise

71
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,803
and offer some deal
regarding those lands of mine,

72
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:43,494
which he still occupies?

73
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,083
He is prepared to pay you

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,375
to renounce your illegal claims

75
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,081
of his lands.

76
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,125
You disappoint
me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.

77
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:53,152
I thought you'd come here
with a serious purpose.

78
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:56,541
- If you would just name your price.
- The land is priceless,

79
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,829
which is why King Horik
wants to keep it for himself.

80
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:01,931
Every piece
of land has a price,

81
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,582
just like every human.

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,294
Well, you don't understand.

83
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:09,403
This is not a small plot of land on
which to grow turnips and onions.

84
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:11,508
We're talking about
a vast swathe of land,

85
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:13,619
and on this land,
in the earth, are minerals,

86
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:15,456
things of great value.

87
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:18,533
Why else would I assert
my claim?

88
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:20,753
King Horik resists your claim,

89
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,678
but still, in good faith,

90
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,776
he is willing
to settle with you.

91
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,420
If you will name
a reasonable price.

92
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,673
At the moment,
my price is King Horik's head.

93
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,494
Well then,

94
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,664
it seems I am done.

95
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,526
Hold on, please,
sit down, sit down.

96
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,529
Let's see if we can find
another way.

97
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:49,429
What do you have in mind?

98
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:51,374
What if my claim
was acknowledged

99
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:54,917
but I was willing to lease the land
back to the king during his lifetime?

100
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:57,900
Or what if we deferred judgment
on ownership,

101
00:06:57,912 --> 00:07:00,472
but shared the mineral rights?

102
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,367
What do you say,

103
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,580
can we start negotiating
in this manner?

104
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,281
Why not?

105
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,467
I have not been
given the authority to...

106
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:19,847
negotiate in this manner.

107
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,432
You mean King Horik sent you
here with nothing but a demand?

108
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,749
And yet he speaks of peace!

109
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,215
I don't know
what is in his mind.

110
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:31,260
Well then,
maybe you should ask him.

111
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,670
Let me make a suggestion:

112
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,214
Why don't you send
one of your men back

113
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:43,146
so he can put to King Horik
my ideas for a remedy.

114
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,985
If you think that will work.

115
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,787
Good. Your messenger
will take several days.

116
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:52,285
So, in the meantime, why don't you and
your men go and visit our famous ash tree?

117
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:55,785
It is famous not only for its size but
because it never loses its leaves,

118
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:57,699
summer or winter.

119
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,553
Some people even say
it's Yggdrasil,

120
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,702
the tree that holds up the sky.

121
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,064
And I will provide you
an escort.

122
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,159
I only have one,
very small request.

123
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:11,361
I would like one of your men to stay
behind here as a kind of security.

124
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,318
You understand, I hope?

125
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,069
My brother Rollo
will stay behind.

126
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,039
Floki!

127
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:45,167
So how long must we travel?

128
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:47,935
It can take us three
days to reach the tree.

129
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:52,748
It looks like rain.

130
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,365
Come.

131
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,071
Why have you come?

132
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,572
I am frightened for my husband.

133
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,372
Do you think your husband
is in some kind of danger?

134
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:22,117
I've had strange
and disturbing dreams.

135
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,632
What happens in your dreams?

136
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,846
Dark shapes
come to me at night.

137
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,692
Monstrous forms.

138
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,754
When I wake,

139
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,913
they skulk in the shadows,
shapeless,

140
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:39,166
but no sooner am I asleep
than they creep forward again.

141
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,147
Ah, yes.

142
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:44,789
The shadows come from
hell's hall.

143
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:48,557
No one can ensnare them,
not even the gods.

144
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,487
What is it that they want?

145
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,516
To take something from you.

146
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:55,872
My life?

147
00:09:55,885 --> 00:10:00,241
No, something far more
important to you than that.

148
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:02,570
My husband's life?

149
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,384
Tell me.

150
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,043
Why must you all force me up

151
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:12,733
and unearth me to sorrows?

152
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:16,832
Your husband is in danger,

153
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,682
but not for his life.

154
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:23,014
He is in danger
from the magical world.

155
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,621
How?

156
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,645
Answer me.

157
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,622
I was unwilling to speak
and I will say no more now!

158
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,567
So, Rollo,

159
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,683
how do you get on
with your brother?

160
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:06,546
We get along fine.

161
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:09,028
Why shouldn't we?

162
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,069
No reason.

163
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,257
But not all brothers
get on so well.

164
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:16,338
I know that
from personal experience.

165
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,773
What do you mean?

166
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,549
I too had a brother.

167
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,786
I loved him.

168
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:27,563
We were very close,
as befits blood brothers.

169
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,476
We fought together
in the shield-wall.

170
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,632
We shared the same women.

171
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:37,415
When my father was killed, there was
fierce competition to replace him as jarl.

172
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:39,263
And although
I was his eldest son

173
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,380
I was not sure
I was going to succeed.

174
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,439
However, I was elected
at the thing.

175
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:46,648
We had a feast to celebrate.

176
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:48,704
My wife was there...

177
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:51,610
my young, beautiful wife -

178
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:54,208
we'd just gotten married -

179
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:58,059
and all the others who had stood
for election against me.

180
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,235
My brother poisoned them...

181
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:05,556
all.

182
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,272
I only survived because...

183
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,352
my wife took the cup
I was about to drink from

184
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,464
and drained it herself
in celebration.

185
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:19,900
I will never forget
her screams.

186
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:25,569
It's my wife's screams that will
haunt me for the rest of my life.

187
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,210
My brother denied
responsibility,

188
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:32,282
but his guilt was too obvious.

189
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,160
So I blinded him
with my own hands,

190
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:38,632
and then I burned him alive.

191
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:45,423
That's what I know about
the love between brothers.

192
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,897
Ragnar...

193
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,027
would never do such a thing.

194
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:55,083
Of course not.

195
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,328
No, your brother is different.

196
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:01,314
Your brother's a great man,

197
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,382
a great warrior.

198
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:07,049
As am I.

199
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,767
I'm sure you are.

200
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:15,146
And yet I've never heard
of you.

201
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,039
Whoa...

202
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,533
Our camp is set up over here.

203
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,279
There's some excellent fishing,
upstream, under the waterfall.

204
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:33,992
I will go.

205
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,085
And I also,

206
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,166
for everybody knows...

207
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:41,101
- Three eyes are better than one.
- Ugh!

208
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,650
You! Look away!

209
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,043
- Who are you?
- Look away at once!

210
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:30,261
What are we suppose
to be looking at?

211
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,846
I'm blind! See?!
I can't see anything!

212
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:35,106
Agh!

213
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,713
Agh!

214
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,476
Arne!

215
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,505
What? You're
going to try to kill us

216
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:43,693
for protecting the reputation
of our mistress?

217
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,363
Ha! Shame on you!

218
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,579
We came upon your
mistress by chance.

219
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,749
We are strangers here,

220
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,688
traveling to the great ash
tree, guests of Jarl Borg.

221
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,634
Jarl Borg? Then why
didn't you say so at once?

222
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:59,712
We will just
return to our horses then.

223
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,952
You spied on me.

224
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:12,941
We meant no harm.

225
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:16,475
They say they
are guests of Jarl Borg.

226
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:19,163
Are you alone?

227
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:22,538
We are traveling with
Earl Ragnar Lothbrok.

228
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:28,360
Then I think that Earl Ragnar owes
me an apology on your behalf.

229
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,611
Don't you?

230
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,862
I never knew that

231
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,264
fresh fish was also
packed in salt.

232
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:44,289
Listen, it's not our fault.

233
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,753
We just saw her bathing.
What were we supposed to do?

234
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,435
Fish.

235
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,851
You did not see her, Ragnar.

236
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:54,026
So you get your cheek slashed

237
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:56,830
and now I'm supposed
to apologize

238
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,458
for you two staring
at a naked body.

239
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:02,789
That's what she said.

240
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:06,373
Who is she, anyway, to put such
a high price on her nakedness?

241
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,085
We didn't ask.

242
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:14,756
I'm intrigued.

243
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,857
What's so intriguing?

244
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,589
Sometimes the gods put things
like this in front of us

245
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,634
as some kind of test.

246
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:23,865
She has set me a challenge

247
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,646
and I am up to task.

248
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,745
See, I'm less interested in
what you say is her beauty,

249
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,055
than what I suspect is her wit.

250
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,498
So tell her

251
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:34,937
I invite her here to join us...

252
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,133
Neither dressed

253
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,326
nor undressed.

254
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,749
What else?

255
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:45,873
Neither hungry

256
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:47,700
nor full,

257
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:50,506
neither in company

258
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,737
nor alone.

259
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,514
Can you remember all of that,

260
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,086
one eye?

261
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,865
What did the Seer tell you?

262
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:07,441
He said that it's true;
That Ragnar is in danger.

263
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,199
From whom?

264
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,190
I don't know.

265
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,082
Who do you think?

266
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:31,733
I think he is in danger
from himself.

267
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,746
Have you ever been
to Yggdrasil before?

268
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,005
No.

269
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:54,584
So, Earl Ragnar,

270
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:56,736
I come to you as you desired:

271
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:59,317
Neither dressed nor undressed,

272
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,670
neither hungry nor full,

273
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,049
neither alone...

274
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:05,074
nor yet in company.

275
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:07,391
Do I pass your test?

276
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:09,360
I owe you an apology.

277
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,343
I accept.

278
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,527
Could I offer you some,
uh, horrible salted fish?

279
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,046
I'm very tempted.

280
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:28,437
You can get tired
of fresh fish.

281
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,075
Come.

282
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,599
Sit, please.

283
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,074
May I ask your name?

284
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:53,693
My name is Aslaug.

285
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:57,237
We're on our way to see
the great ash tree.

286
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,401
Of course.

287
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:03,126
You are welcome to join us.

288
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,306
Will you come along, Aslaug?

289
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,267
- Siggy, what is it?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

290
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,349
Oh, I visited my cousin
a few days ago.

291
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:36,058
She had just buried
her young son.

292
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,647
Why did he die?

293
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,386
One day he was fine,
and the next he

294
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,002
caught a fever that

295
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,858
made him sweat and cry out in
the night, and the next day...

296
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,619
she put him in the ground.

297
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:56,496
But if it is Yggdrasil,

298
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,216
then it must be the same tree

299
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:01,306
that Lord Odin
once hanged himself from.

300
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,541
Why not?

301
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,998
All things are possible.

302
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,022
"I hung from a windy
tree for nine long nights,

303
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,717
wounded by a spear,

304
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,764
dedicated to Odin,

305
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:32,120
from that tree of which
no man knows

306
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:34,893
from where its roots run."

307
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:50,850
No, please...

308
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:53,254
Look after my daughter...

309
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:55,083
First.

310
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,109
It's all right.

311
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,655
What's wrong, boy?

312
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,950
What do you think?

313
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:27,710
My father is making
a fool of himself.

314
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:30,167
He's enjoying himself in the
company of a beautiful woman.

315
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:31,947
What's foolish about that?

316
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:33,869
Some day you'll do
the same thing.

317
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:36,755
If Lagertha were here,
she'd cut his balls off.

318
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,880
Then it's a good
thing she's not.

319
00:22:40,522 --> 00:22:42,156
Listen to me, my friend.

320
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:44,617
Your father and mother
are a famous couple.

321
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,774
They love each other.
Everybody knows that.

322
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:51,017
So don't begrudge your old man
a little harmless fun, huh?

323
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,433
I trust all
is to your satisfaction.

324
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:23,610
You feed me very well.

325
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:24,963
You're an important guest.

326
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:29,237
We would like to keep you entertained
until your brother returns.

327
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,756
You always talk
about my brother.

328
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,773
What choice do I have?

329
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:38,116
He is your earl.

330
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:45,798
Which one would you like
tonight?

331
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:49,553
Why don't you take
both of them?

332
00:23:50,176 --> 00:23:52,831
I don't need to be bribed
with women.

333
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:00,091
What is it you want, Rollo?

334
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:04,510
What is it you really want?

335
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:14,548
Fenrir, the giant wolf,

336
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,255
could not be constrained
by any means known to man,

337
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:22,276
so the dwarves forged a chain,

338
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:24,622
but not from metal.

339
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:28,408
Nothing made by man
could constrain Fenrir,

340
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:31,705
so they forged it
from the things we cannot see

341
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:34,532
and the things we cannot hear.

342
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:37,096
Like the breath of a fish...

343
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:40,081
the sound a moving cat makes.

344
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,799
The roots...

345
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,967
of a mountain.

346
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:45,087
You know?

347
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,668
Of course I know!

348
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,088
These things interest me!

349
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:56,330
I came to ask about Jarl Borg.

350
00:24:57,318 --> 00:24:59,179
He won't sell.

351
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:01,308
He wants to make a deal.

352
00:25:01,456 --> 00:25:05,073
I'm not interested in deals.

353
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:08,148
That would make it hard
for Ragnar.

354
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,341
Ragnar will come
to the right conclusion,

355
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,470
and make the right decision.

356
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:16,750
Don't you care
if the negotiations fail?

357
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:18,610
Mm...

358
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,625
Look!

359
00:25:58,211 --> 00:26:00,255
I am going to die.

360
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:02,830
No,

361
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:04,874
you are not going to die.

362
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:08,546
The Seer might think that he
is the only one in Kattegat

363
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,727
with the gift of prophecy,

364
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,582
but he's wrong,

365
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,531
and I know you are not
going to die.

366
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,572
I should tell you the
truth about who I really am.

367
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:29,970
I am Princess Aslaug.

368
00:26:29,998 --> 00:26:32,774
My mother was
the shield-maiden Brunhilde.

369
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:40,378
Everyone knows the
renown of your mother.

370
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,643
But I am not her.

371
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:46,166
I am myself.

372
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:49,370
Both my parents are dead now,

373
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:51,823
and I did not know them anyway.

374
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:54,578
Why did you come along with me?

375
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:57,053
Because I had no choice.

376
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,834
Hmm...

377
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,619
Why did you do that?

378
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,870
Because I had no choice.

379
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,953
I hate you.

380
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:15,782
It's disgusting.

381
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,047
I could not help myself.

382
00:28:19,071 --> 00:28:21,094
Shall I tell that to Lagertha,

383
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,221
your wife?

384
00:28:22,253 --> 00:28:23,953
If you want to.

385
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:28,381
You cannot love her that much
after all,

386
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:31,862
no matter what you say,
no matter what people think.

387
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,479
I don't care what people think.

388
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:37,687
Of course I love your mother.

389
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,151
Swear to me that
it will not happen again.

390
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:58,111
I swear to you
it won't happen again.

391
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,686
I love you.

392
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,719
Now, go play.

393
00:29:43,368 --> 00:29:45,211
Unnngh!

394
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:03,957
No!

395
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,446
No!

396
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:09,549
No!

397
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:23,251
Athelstan?

398
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:29,946
He is so weak he cannot eat.

399
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,008
Pray to the gods,

400
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,780
please, for him.

401
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,023
Wait, no.

402
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,633
I said no.

403
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,671
No.

404
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:28,238
Lord of lords...

405
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:30,434
we make this offering to you,

406
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:34,012
hoping you will
find it pleasing.

407
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:16,794
Can you try a little more?

408
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:31,861
Gyda...

409
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,021
Enjoy!

410
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:04,369
What's wrong with you?

411
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,211
I'm carrying your child.

412
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,943
Did the Seer not promise you
more sons?

413
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:29,264
Whoa...

414
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:43,123
We welcome our
guests to this feast.

415
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:46,538
Now tell us what you learned
from King Horik?

416
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:50,331
What compromises
is he willing to make?

417
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:53,086
Can I not eat first?

418
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:05,430
Well, he said...

419
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,525
What did he say?

420
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:20,380
What did he say?

421
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:25,565
He will make no compromises,

422
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,610
no deals.

423
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,359
He say you must name
your price for the land.

424
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,589
Or?

425
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,839
He didn't say "or."

426
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,331
It seems your mission
has been entirely wasted,

427
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,570
Ragnar Lothbrok.

428
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,038
You and your men must leave here
in the morning.

429
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:55,275
Unless you want to repudiate
King Horik,

430
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:58,672
renounce your allegiance
to him.

431
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,234
I see.

432
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,570
Very well.

433
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,229
Good.

434
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:24,762
War.

435
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,092
Odin...

436
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:45,015
So, my friend, the die is cast.

437
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,540
King Horik has left me
no choice.

438
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,851
I must attack him and claim
what is rightfully mine.

439
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:55,624
Your brother will clearly not
support me, but the question is,

440
00:39:55,698 --> 00:39:57,632
will you?

441
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,770
Will you fight alongside me?

442
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:11,034
Together, you and I can
carve out the new kingdom.

443
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:23,974
Isn't that
what you really want?

444
00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:27,840
The death of your brother
and the start of your own fame?

445
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,784
Well, what do you say?

446
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:14,015
I say yes.

447
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:20,251
I will fight with you.

448
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,138
I will fight with you
against my brother.

449
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:45,707
