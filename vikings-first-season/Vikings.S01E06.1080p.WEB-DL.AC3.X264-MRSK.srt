<i>Previously on "Vikings":</i>

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,404
This is an ambitious man.

3
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,439
<i>And he resents the fact
that he owes me</i>

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,409
<i>Loyalty and obedience
as his chieftain.</i>

5
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,679
<i>You accept that
you're a criminal?</i>

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,482
<i>Worthy only of defeat.</i>

7
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,516
<i>After him!</i>

8
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,584
<i>Worthy only of death.</i>

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,621
<i>Where is father?
Is he dead?</i>

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:26,425
I've come to warn you.
My husband, he hates you.

11
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:30,195
<i>Earl Haraldson has played
a trick on rollo</i>

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,198
<i>Trying to find
where you were.</i>

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,601
Then he tortured him.

14
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,336
He tortured my brother?

15
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,772
It's a trap for you,
Ragnar.

16
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:41,607
I want you to ask
for a meeting with the Earl,

17
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,676
Challenge him
to a personal combat...With me.

00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,737
My Lord, this man says he has
a message for you

30
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,507
From Ragnar Lothbrok.

31
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,775
Let him go!

32
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,780
What's the message?

33
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:01,453
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you
to meet him in single combat.

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,263
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very
high opinion of himself.

35
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,732
Well, he is a descendant
of Odin.

36
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:22,741
Ragnar said that
if you refuse his challenge,

37
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,645
Then shame would follow you
the rest of your life.

38
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,813
There would be greater shame

39
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,650
In accepting a challenge
from a criminal.

40
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,418
That would suggest
that I take him seriously;

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,487
That I see him
as an equal.

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,358
The challenge is declined.

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,393
<i>When Ragnar Lothbrok appears
in Kattegat,</i>

44
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,862
<i>He will be put in chains.</i>

45
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,499
<i>Stones and bones.</i>

46
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,269
He searches for your death.

47
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,337
Does he desire to be Earl?

48
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,943
If he kills you,
would it not be so?

49
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,854
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok
I accept his challenge.

50
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,789
<i>Take him away.</i>

51
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,815
Ragnar...
What?

52
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,553
Let's go away.

53
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,889
Let's leave here.

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,626
This is not the only place
for us.

55
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,895
He is old.

56
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,999
What are you frightened of?

57
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,935
You can't fight.

58
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,838
You're still too weak.

59
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,910
Perhaps that makes us equal.

60
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,551
Never fight unless you know
the odds are in your favor.

61
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,587
That is our way.

62
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,891
Who sets the odds?

63
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,735
Our fates are already decided.

64
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,312
You don't believe that
and neither do I.

65
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,950
You are wrong

66
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,755
I do believe it.

67
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,572
come to bed.

68
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,374
You need to rest,
to sleep.

69
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,777
Yes, I will.

70
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,448
There's always time
to sleep.

71
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,420
I was thinking
about our boys,

72
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,489
What they would
look like now.

73
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,062
Don't...
Don't think about them.

74
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,331
Think about tomorrow.

75
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,467
When I must kill a man

76
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,937
For whom I have
the utmost respect.

77
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,542
<i>Respect?</i>

78
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,713
You respect
Ragnar Lothbrok?

79
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,514
Why not?

80
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,616
He is what I used to be -

81
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,352
Restless, ambitious.

82
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,858
And he was right about
the western lands.

83
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,861
But I always knew that
in my heart.

84
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,568
<i>Then why didn't you
tell him?</i>

85
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,103
Because the moment
that I reached out

86
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:14,639
Was the moment
that all my friends,

87
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,675
All my supporters
would have deserted me

88
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,043
And joined him.

89
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,847
It was impossible
to do it.

90
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,919
Our fates have
brought us together.

91
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:33,525
And maybe he's opened
the western lands for me.

92
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,967
That is my hope,
after I kill him.

93
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,807
The seer promised
you would kill him?

94
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,042
Yes.

95
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,112
Good.

96
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,663
I'm sure that's
our first child.

97
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,499
Now get up and fetch me
some pickled herrings.

98
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,535
I'm starving.

99
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,904
I don't like the smell of them
in the bed.

100
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,105
Your clothes are smelly enough
as it is.

101
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,641
Why can't you just wash
like everyone else?

102
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,609
I thought a wife wasn't supposed
to nag her husband

103
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,179
Until they'd had time
to grow tired of each other?

104
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:29,948
If you don't get up
and fetch me some herrings

105
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,116
I will beat you.

106
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,685
Perhaps that will make you
show a little life

107
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,153
When we have sex,
in any case!

108
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,922
Very well.

109
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,123
I'll go.

110
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,560
<i>I can't wait till tomorrow.</i>

111
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,495
Personal combat
is always thrilling.

112
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,464
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?

113
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,966
I've heard many people
talk about him.

114
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,202
<i>Thyri
I don't talk about him.</i>

115
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,204
He's my father's enemy.

116
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,122
Lord,

117
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,925
High one, hear me.

118
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,862
Listen to me.

119
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,902
Give me your favor this day.

120
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:00,939
Grant me your blessing
as you have done in the past,

121
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,842
<i>And I will make a sacrifice
of my enemy,</i>

122
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,177
If his death pleases you.

123
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,181
<i>Give me a sign...</i>

124
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,292
I cannot feel your presence...

00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,862

00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,499
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

169
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,102
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

170
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,572
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

171
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,200
<i>Take it!</i>

172
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,801
Take it! Take it!

173
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,845
Take it!

174
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,598
Lord Ragnar,

175
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,167
I have come to swear to you
my allegiance

176
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,337
And fealty to you
and your family

177
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,805
From this day.

178
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,808
Leif, you are my friend.

179
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,712
And you, Torstein,

180
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,514
<i>And you, Arne,</i>

181
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,782
You are my friends.

182
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,895
What is your name?

183
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,197
Old
Tostig, Lord Ragnar.

184
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,568
Do you swear allegiance
and fealty

185
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,570
To me and to my family

186
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,172
From this day forth?

187
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,406
That won't be
so long then!

188
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,180
By my sacred rings I swear.

189
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,416
But I also have a favor to ask,
Lord.

190
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,717
What is this favor?

191
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,187
That the next time
you go raiding,

192
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,189
You take me with you.

193
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,733
I do not wish to insult you,
but the truth is you-

194
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,569
<i>That I am too old?</i>

195
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,406
Yes, I am old.

196
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,777
<i>But I have been a warrior
all my life.</i>

197
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,647
Many years I sailed
with Lord Haraldson

198
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,850
And fought battles
against the eastlanders,

199
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:24,555
<i>And I watched all
the companions of my youth die.</i>

200
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,592
And though I fought with them
in the shield-wall,

201
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,861
Never once was I touched
by a blade.

202
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,267
<i>All the friends and companions
of my youth are dead</i>

203
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,237
<i>And feasting and drinking
with the aesir</i>

204
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,806
<i>In the halls of the gods!</i>

205
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,242
<i>While I...</i>

206
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,310
<i>I am forsaken</i>

207
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,680
Bereft.

208
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,251
Which is why,
I beg you, Lord,

209
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:57,855
Gift me the chance to die
with honor in battle,

210
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,025
And join my friends
in Valhalla.

211
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,778
This summer, we shall have
more ships to go west,

212
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,880
<i>For that is our future.</i>

213
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,016
<i>When we return to England...</i>

214
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,985
Let's take him with us!

215
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,687
All in favor?

216
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:30,921
Aye.

217
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,870
There is no need for you
to swear.

218
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,774
You have already paid
a heavy price

219
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,076
For your loyalty to me.

220
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,516
Nevertheless,
I will swear, brother.

221
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,718
<i>I swear to be true to you,</i>

222
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,954
Your wife and your family...

223
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,925
As long as
your good fortune holds.

224
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,500
How will we ever be equal now,
my brother?

225
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,939
Why have you agreed
to grant Earl Haraldson

226
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,007
Such a big funeral.

227
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,078
Was he not your enemy?

228
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,515
He was also a great man
and a warrior.

229
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,520
He earned his renown
in this life,

230
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:13,591
And now, in death,
he deserves such a funeral.

231
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,698
I want to show you
something.

You need a drink,

Drink.

Hail, Ragnar!

<i>Hail, Ragnar Lothbrok!</i>

Move!

282
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,496
I ask permission
to light the pyre.

283
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,453
I have something important
to tell you, husband.

284
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,225
I am with child again.

285
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,407
I know you're a boy!

286
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,743
The seer told me.

287
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,248
O by all the gods,
my son,

288
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,055
You have made me
a happy man.

289
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,520
Have you come to kill us?

290
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,456
Why would I do that?

291
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,525
Because Ragnar told you to.

292
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,260
It is often the way
that the new Earl

293
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,197
Deals with the family
of the old.

294
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,266
Ragnar won't kill you.

295
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,438
How can you be sure?

296
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,274
<i>My brother doesn't
hold grudges.</i>

297
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,743
He's strange that way.

298
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,785
Well...

299
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,790
Even if we don't die,

300
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,526
They will still shun us
like a bad smell.

301
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,595
And they'll make it
so we have to leave here,

302
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,563
Even though they know
no one else will take us in.

303
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:35,499
They won't.

304
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,769
Not if I vouch for you.

305
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,774
No one will force you
to go anywhere.

306
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,712
They wouldn't dare.

307
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,554
What do you want
in return?

308
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,561
You were once married
to an Earl.

309
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,801
Would you not like to be married
to another one?

310
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,804
Who?

311
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,343
What do you mean who?

312
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,881
Me!

313
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,461
The pigs are fattening nicely.

314
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,863
Just like your mother.

315
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,401
It's cold,

316
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,270
Even in here.

317
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,546
I can't wait
for the spring,

318
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,481
Or the raids.

319
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:34,017
I want to go to England.

320
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,288
No.

321
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,724
What?

322
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,826
I said no.
But why?

323
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,894
Because I said so.

324
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,500
Don't be too impatient
to put yourself in danger.

325
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,802
But you cannot alter
my fate!

326
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,307
You sound like your uncle,

327
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,377
When he doesn't know
what to say.

328
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,746
Come on.

329
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,060
Ragnar, I have heard
many of your stories,

330
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:18,795
But tell me...

331
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,897
What is Ragnarok?

332
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,371
I have heard mention of it
several times,

333
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,373
But so far
no one has explained

334
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,909
The meaning to me.

335
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:35,945
Let's show this
ignorant christian

336
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,548
What Ragnarok is.

337
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,687
Get the leaves.

338
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,756
The twilight of the gods
will happen like this

339
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,959
There will be three years
of terrible winters...

340
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,597
And summers of black sunlight.

341
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,372
<i>People will lose all hope</i>

342
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,374
<i>And surrender to greed,</i>

343
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,710
<i>Incest and civil war.</i>

344
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,714
<i>Midgardsormen,
the world serpent,</i>

345
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,017
<i>Will come lunging
from the ocean,</i>

346
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:52,622
<i>Dragging the tides in
and floOding the world.</i>

347
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,460
The wolf, giant fenrir,

348
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:02,098
<i>Will break
his invisible chains...</i>

349
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,136
<i>The skies will open</i>

350
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,806
<i>And surt the fire-giant</i>

351
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,741
<i>Will come flaming
across the bridge</i>

352
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,910
<i>To destroy the gods.</i>

353
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:19,482
<i>Odin will ride out
of the gates of Valhalla</i>

354
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:23,686
<i>To do battle for a last time
against the wolf.</i>

355
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,790
<i>Thor will kill the serpent,</i>

356
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:29,492
<i>But die from its venom.</i>

357
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,498
<i>Surt will spread fire
across the earth.</i>

358
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:40,537
<i>At last,
fenrir will swallow the sun.</i>

359
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,174
Nooooooooo!

360
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:28,885
So where did these northmen
come ashore?

361
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:29,919
They didn't.

362
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,955
What do you mean,
they didn't?

363
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,790
<i>They came in three ships,</i>

364
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:38,094
And those ships
are now sailing up the tyne.

365
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,068
They have ships
that can cross oceans

366
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,136
But also sail up rivers?

367
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,507
What manner of men
are these?

368
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,075
If they are sailing up
the tyne,

369
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:55,578
Then, sire,
we shall soon find out.

370
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,779
Ah yes,
my Lord wigea,

371
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,849
Of course you know
all about them.

372
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,186
You accused them
of having supernatural powers,

373
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:07,156
Which is why a small force
of them defeated you.

374
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,559
I merely said they fought
like demons,

375
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:13,563
Like men possessed,
with no fear of death.

376
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,066
Unlike you, my Lord?

377
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,936
I fear death
as much as the next man,

378
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:22,872
But I have no fear
that afterwards

379
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,742
God will raise me up again.

380
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:28,144
Oh, well said.

381
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,548
Come, all of you!

382
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,618
I have something new
to show you.

383
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,695
<i>Let the serpents bite
these devils.</i>

384
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,797
Let them also bite
those too weak

385
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,832
And afraid to fight
to the death

386
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,268
For their king and master.

387
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,636
My Lord!
No! No!

388
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,273
You look terrified,
my Lord wigea.

389
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,742
<i>Have you lost your faith?</i>

390
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,244
Are you not certain anymore

391
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,979
That god will raise you up
from the grave?

392
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,714
Have mercy

393
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,716
Personally,
I hope he does not.

394
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:09,652
I hope he leaves you there
to rot.

395
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,254
Nooooooo!

396
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,356
Ungh!

397
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,661
No! Christ!

398
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,265
God!

399
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,901
Nooooo!

400
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:32,675
Now let us prepare
to defend ourselves

401
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:35,878
Against these heathens
and barbarians.
