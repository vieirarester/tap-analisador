Aethelwulf?!

Thank God you are come.

36
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:15,054
What on earth
made you think I would not, sire?

37
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,358
No, I never doubted you.
But others...

38
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:22,728
Our own youngest brother,
fled to Mercia.

39
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,964
He was always the runt
of the litter.

40
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,699
Our parents should've
drowned him at birth.

41
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:30,336
Where are the heathens now?

42
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:32,572
Only one, perhaps two days away

43
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,407
and your forces are ready
and armed?

44
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:37,276
Yes, if you are ready
to lead them.

45
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,212
I would regard it
a great honor, sire,

46
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:42,815
to defend thy kingdom
and our homeland.

47
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,984
And there's no
man better, lord Aethelwulf.

48
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:46,652
The poets sing
your battle praises

49
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:47,854
in the halls.

50
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:49,522
That's because I paid them.

51
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:53,559
If you paid them,
they'd sing your praises too.

52
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,861
That's poets for you!

53
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,134
My lady, pray,
have you no time for laughter?

54
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,405
No, my lord Aethelwulf,
only for fear.

55
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:34,867
How soon will they come?

56
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,836
Soon enough.

57
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:38,905
I hope so.

58
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:42,375
I can't wait for Valhalla.

59
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:09,535
Good day to you, folk.
What is the problem here?

60
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:12,471
The problem is her!

61
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:13,839
What has she done?

62
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:17,443
She has had a
child - the boy in her arms.

63
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:19,545
What of it?

64
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,113
He's not my child.

65
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:24,850
<i>We tried for many years</i>
<i>to have children,</i>

66
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:27,520
but without success.

67
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,021
And then, just over a year ago,

68
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,923
a young man came to the door.

69
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:34,193
I remember the day,
I was making a loom.

70
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,996
The young man
said his name was Rig.

71
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:39,765
He gave us some good advice
on our work

72
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,068
and stayed at our house.

73
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,470
After three days, he left...

74
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:48,007
And then nine months later,
she gave birth to a son.

75
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,881
Whose child is it?

76
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,685
I do not know, my lady.

77
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:03,022
We were all in the same bed.

78
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,057
I was too scared-you see?

79
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:07,627
She is not an honest woman.

80
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,528
She had sex with Rig,

81
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:12,765
and could not bring herself
to tell me the truth!

82
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,038
Do you know who this Rig was?

83
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,941
No. He was just a young man.

84
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,110
On the contrary.

85
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:27,246
We know from
our ancient stories

86
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:29,849
that Rig is another name
for Heimdal.

87
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,819
The God Heimdal?

88
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
My lady!

89
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,857
Yes, the God Heimdal!

90
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,725
You are fortunate

91
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,627
that he chose your household
to appear in.

92
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:42,862
That's just a story!

93
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,997
Our whole lives
are just stories.

94
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:48,067
You should be ashamed
you did not trust your wife,

95
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:51,137
<i>despite the joy and comfort</i>
<i>she has brought you,</i>

96
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,539
<i>and the fact that a God</i>
<i>chose you</i>

97
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,441
of all people to visit.

98
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:00,780
Do not punish her,
but rejoice with her.

99
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:04,183
Drink wine with her.

100
00:07:04,284 --> 00:07:05,885
And sacrifice
one of your animals

101
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:08,287
to Heimdal the God.

102
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,458
But if I hear
you have harmed this woman,

103
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:15,528
or this child,

104
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,897
you will answer for it to me!

105
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,127
It seems they
intend to stay here a while.

106
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,162
I had not expected that.

107
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,798
My lord, why don't we attack?

108
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,801
They have a strong position.

109
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:57,803
Perhaps if we can make them
leave their position

110
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:59,105
and attack us.

111
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:00,940
<i>How can
we force them to do that?</i>

112
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,809
They're scavengers,
little more than beasts.

113
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,745
We must be able
to out-think them.

114
00:08:05,846 --> 00:08:07,446
<i>Saxon warrior 2</i>
<i>if we leave it much longer,</i>

115
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,814
they'll be even better dug-in.

116
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:11,183
My lord, if a wolf comes
into your sheep fold,

117
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,718
you don't try to out-think it.

118
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,286
You go in and drive it away,

119
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:16,989
- or kill it!
- How dare you argue with me?!

120
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,724
Lord Aethelwulf,
forgive us. We only meant...

121
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,760
I know what you meant.

122
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:23,329
You meant that you're already
greater warriors than I am...

123
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,964
although only yesterday
you were still green

124
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,766
sucking on
your mother's breasts.

125
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:29,268
Go do your jobs. Set up camp.

126
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:40,479
You see them up there?

127
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,882
Yes, I can see them.

128
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:47,019
What're we waiting for?

129
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,388
To see what they'll do.

130
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:54,193
So you want to hand them
the initiative.

131
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:56,095
We can't afford
to lose half our men

132
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:58,564
by being stupid and attacking.

133
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,335
<i>We wait until the odds</i>
<i>are in our favor.</i>

134
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:30,996
Shh... shh... shh...

135
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:32,932
Shh... shh... shh...

136
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:35,668
Shh...

137

<i>Awake! Awake! Under attack!</i>

138
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,014
Agh!

139

<i>They're on us! Weapons!</i>

143
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,288
Ungh!

144
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,326
My lord! We're being attacked!

145
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:27,513
Amen.

146
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,471
Who are you?

147
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,565
I'm lord Aethelwulf,
brother of king Aelle.

148
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,579
<i>You are the
brother of the king,</i>

149
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,781
yet you lead his army?

150
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,750
Hmm.

151
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:19,987
Does he send you to fight
all his battles?

152
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,123
In the bedroom too?

153
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,529
<i>Ragnar!</i>

154
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:27,964
Come and see!

155
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:33,469
Their iron is stronger
and better than ours.

156
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:37,640
And we've captured
a dozen of their horses.

157
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,209
<i>I'm hungry already!</i>

158
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,546
What ails you my friend?

159
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,982
The gods won't lift my curse.

160
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:50,019
I am fated to live forever
on this miserable earth.

161
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,229
Who is this?

162
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,730
This?

163
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,533
This is the king's brother.

164
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,103
What do you say?

165
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,572
Shall we go visit the king?

166
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,174
<i>God help us!</i>

167
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,177
My brother defeated. Dead.

168
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:18,079
God help Northumbria.

169
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:20,782
Sire, we do not
know if your brother is dead.

170
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,885
But we do know, my
lord, that he was defeated!

171
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:29,223
Who are these barbarians,
these savages?

172
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:32,326
Why have they come
to torment us?

173
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,929
Sire, some learned and wise men

174
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,032
say that these northmen
have been sent here by God

175
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:39,734
to punish our people

176
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:43,070
for their many sins
and transgressions.

177
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,606
That we have departed from
the path of righteousness

178
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,241
that our lord set out,

179
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:50,812
so now he is holding us
to terrible account.

180
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:55,550
Forgive me, sire,

181
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:58,186
but what if God has not
sent these northmen here

182
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,988
to plague us?

183
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,757
Then who has, pray?

184
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,292
Could it not, sire,

185
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,127
rather be the work
of the devil?

186
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,265
<i>Go on then, my lord.
What is your advice?</i>

187
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,267
<i>Noble 3</i>
<i>my advice, sire, is that,</i>

188
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,503
as we are facing
the forces of Satan,

189
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,039
we must resist them
at all costs.

190
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,875
Even at the cost of...
Of all our lives,

191
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:22,944
if necessary.

192
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,780
<i>For evil cannot be accommodated</i>

193
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:28,216
nor yet ever bargained with.

194
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,852
Aye!

195
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,789
<i>Sire, if I might speak?</i>

196
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,258
<i>I-I put it to you</i>

197
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,694
that it might be that
these pagans have come here

198
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,462
by their own account,

199
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,731
and that they are neither
of God

200
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,600
nor the devil.

201
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,401
They are just savage men

202
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,670
more interested in robbery
and plunder

203
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:51,739
than in matters of the spirit.

204
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,875
Then what is your advice?

205
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,611
Sire, since
they have come for gain,

206
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:59,213
then let us offer them
enough money,

207
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:01,449
or whatever else they desire,

208
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,218
to go away
and leave us in peace!

209
00:15:05,787 --> 00:15:08,656
Shame! Shame on you!
Shame on you!

210
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:10,558
<i>He is right!</i>

211
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,560
Why waste more blood?

212
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,129
Let's pay them off!

213
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,633
<i>My lords,</i>

214
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:21,903
let me think on it,
just a little while.

215
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,106
In the meantime,
let it be known

216
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:28,042
I have sent envoys out
to raise more men to arms,

217
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,978
for our use if need be.

218
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:34,415
Long live the king!

219
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:46,260
<i>Contend, o lord,</i>

220
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:49,830
<i>against those</i>
<i>who contend with me;</i>

221
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,401
Fight against those
who fight against me!

222
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,039
Draw the spear and javelin
against my pursuers;

223
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,945
Say to my soul,
"I am your salvation."

224
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,618
Sire, they are here.

225
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,035
Greetings.

226
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,603
King Aelle invites your leader

227
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,639
to meet him in his villa
to talk.

228
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,943
Who is your leader?

229
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,684
The king did not know that
his brother was still alive.

230
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,188
<i>He would like to talk to you</i>
<i>about what he can give you,</i>

231
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,691
to set his brother free.

232
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:33,200
Do you accept
the king's invitation?

233
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:42,143
<i>Where are you going?</i>

234
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,993
We should attack,
while they are weak.

235
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,095
How long will it take them
to raise another army?

236
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,230
<i>Attack, attack, attack!</i>

237
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,699
<i>That's all he ever says.</i>

238
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:09,870
I want to talk to the king.

239
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,405
<i>What is there to talk about?</i>

240
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:12,706
Imagine the treasures
the king keeps

241
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,076
in his household?

242
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,710
<i>I want them.</i>

243
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,313
I want to see how he lives...

244
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:22,316
What manner of men they are,

245
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,918
and I'm hungry.

246
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,355
<i>If we agree</i>
<i>to walk into his house</i>

247
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:30,458
he can kill each
and every one of us.

248
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:34,528
You forget, we
hold his brother hostage.

249
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:38,365
Why should he care
about his brother?

250
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,202
Do I not care about mine?

251
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,204
<i>They're coming!</i>

252
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:52,806
My lord Eadric.

253
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:33,514
<i>Sire, this
man is Ragnar Lothbrok,</i>

254
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,950
<i>his brother rollo,</i>

255
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:37,851
and their companions.

256
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:40,888
Ah yes, Ragnar Lothbrok...

257
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,859
We've heard that name before.

258
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:50,631
We are pleased
you have decided to talk to us.

259
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,144
Perhaps, sire,

260
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:07,047
you should invite them
to eat first.

261
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:12,246
Forgive me.
Let us feast together...

262
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,955
And then talk.

263
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:25,888
_

264
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:28,029
_

265
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,279
The king!

266
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,655
Ragnar Lothbrok,

267
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:44,624
may I present my wife Ealswith,
and my son, egbert.

268
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:54,768
Hello.

269
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,775
<i>Go on now.</i>

270
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,038
<i>In the name of
the father, and of the son,</i>

271
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,875
and of the holy spirit, amen.

272
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:36,343
Amen.

273
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:37,911
<i>Amen.</i>

274
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,782
Shall we talk, king?

275
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:55,989
<i>Very well.</i>

276
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,924
What do you want,

277
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,026
for the safe return
of my brother

278
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,462
and for leaving my kingdom?

279
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:05,599
Is he a priest?

280
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,803
He's a bishop of our church.

281
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:11,805
A man of God.

282
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:14,207
I too have a man of God
at home.

283
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:21,414
Two thousand pounds
in gold and silver.

284
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:22,716
What did he say?

285
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:24,050
How much?

286
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,852
Two thousand pounds.

287
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:32,058
I do not think I heard you
properly, Ragnar Lothbrok.

288
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,194
Hmm...

289
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:41,001
Two thousand pounds in weight.

290
00:24:43,204 --> 00:24:45,538
That is the price.

291
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:10,096
I agree to the terms.

292
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:12,298
Good.

293
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:23,877
But first...

294
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:26,713
You must return my brother.

295
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:30,283
When we receive payment,
you shall have your brother.

296
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:34,921
You must give me time
to collect such a vast amount.

297
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:40,260
<i>And in the meantime,</i>

298
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:43,463
you and your men must remain
in your camp

299
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:46,166
and make no further attacks
on my people

300
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:48,334
or their property.

301
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:50,970
Agreed.

302
00:25:51,072 --> 00:25:54,708
Sire! How can we
trust the word of a pagan?

303
00:25:56,844 --> 00:26:00,246
Let me baptize one of them.

304
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:03,650
There is one further condition.

305
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:06,553
I desire that either you,
or one of your companions,

306
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,989
agrees to be baptized
into our faith.

307
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:11,157
And that way,

308
00:26:11,258 --> 00:26:14,227
I can make peace with a friend
and fellow Christian...

309
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,096
And not an enemy.

310
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:20,066
You want one of
us to become Christian?

311
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,668
Yes.

312
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,947
<i>Tostig!</i>

313
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:50,096
I... will be Christian.

314
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:13,453
My lady Lagertha,

315
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:14,888
I hope you can find it
in your heart

316
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:17,290
to speak to the wife
of the late Earl.

317
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:19,292
Of course. Hello, Siggy.

318
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,060
Please sit down and join us.

319
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:22,562
Bjorn wait!

320
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,698
Earl Haraldson tried
to kill my father.

321
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,202
I know.

322
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,704
And if he had succeeded,

323
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:34,774
I would be standing
where Siggy's standing now.

324
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,379
So what would you like me
to say to her?

325
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:46,419
I would ask her to sit down.

326
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:50,323
Thank you.

327
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:00,567
What can I do for you?

328
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:03,369
It is what I can do for you.

329
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:07,240
I want to serve you.

330
00:28:10,077 --> 00:28:12,345
That is not necessary.

331
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:19,652
I remember very well
how I served

332
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:21,955
the father of my church,

333
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:23,823
<i>and it did me no harm.</i>

334
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:28,695
<i>In fact, I found in service</i>
<i>a great freedom and honor.</i>

335
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:31,231
When I accepted that I should
forget about myself

336
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:33,499
and serve father Cuthbert...

337
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,136
Well... then I became happy.

338
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,289
If it's really what you want,
I accept your offer.

339
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:01,895
Thank you.

340
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,266
<i>You and your daughter
are now under my protection,</i>

341
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,335
but I will never treat you
as a servant.

342
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:27,954
O lord, holy father,
almighty and eternal God,

343
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:32,058
expel the devil and his
kin from this person:

344
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,927
From the head, from the hair,

345
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:36,162
from the brain, from the brow,

346
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,231
<i>from the ears,</i>
<i>from the nostrils,</i>

347
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:41,467
<i>from the mouth,</i>
<i>from beneath the tongue,</i>

348
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:43,336
<i>from the throat, from the neck,</i>

349
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,238
<i>from the chest, from the heart,</i>

350
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:48,641
<i>from the entire interior</i>
<i>of the body,</i>

351
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:50,343
<i>from the thoughts,</i>
<i>from the words,</i>

352
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:52,278
<i>and from the deeds,</i>

353
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:55,848
<i>in the name of Jesus</i>
<i>Christ our lord.</i>

354
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,217
Amen.

355
00:29:59,386 --> 00:30:01,754
I anoint thee...

356
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:05,992
In the name of the father

357
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:09,429
and of the son
and of the holy spirit.

358
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:10,763
Amen.

359
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:20,239
Et spiritus sancti.

360
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,713
<i>I now pronounce
you baptized and born again,</i>

361
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,749
with the new Christian
name of Rolf.

362
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:42,729
<i>May the lord bless you</i>
<i>and keep you,</i>

363
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,365
<i>from this day hence,</i>
<i>and for ever.</i>

364
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:46,766
<i>Amen.</i>

365
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,623
We have
witnessed a true miracle.

366
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:12,825
Now I ask you to fulfill
your promises,

367
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:16,729
return to your ships,

368
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,032
and await your payment
in peace.

369
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:21,234
Agreed, Ragnar Lothbrok?

370
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:55,707
What is it?

371
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:58,076
I can't sleep.

372
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,815
Come here, beside me, daughter.

373
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:14,526
What worries you?

374
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:17,629
I fear for father, so far away.

375
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:26,271
Our lives are fated, Gyda.

376
00:32:26,338 --> 00:32:28,773
We all have to accept that.

377
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:38,349
I can feel it moving
underneath my hand.

378
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:42,020
Mm-hmm. He has a strong kick.

379
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:44,889
He? Are you so sure it's a boy?

380
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,394
A long time ago,
the seer prophesized

381
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:52,397
that your father
would have many sons.

382
00:32:52,498 --> 00:32:54,866
That's how I know it's a boy.

383
00:33:01,874 --> 00:33:04,876
Now sleep.

384
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:15,353
<i>Oh!</i>

385
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,368
I won again!

386
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,005
Well done... Rolf!

387
00:33:36,108 --> 00:33:38,009
What's wrong with you, Floki?

388
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,778
Oh, there's nothing wrong
with me.

389
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:43,982
I did not renounce the gods
in front of everyone.

390
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:48,353
It was a joke.

391
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:50,388
<i>I didn't believe it.</i>

392
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:53,024
I didn't even know
what the old fool was saying.

393
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:55,193
It doesn't matter.

394
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:58,096
Surely you've made them
very angry.

395
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:06,337
Don't be stupid.

396
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:09,340
No, you are the stupid one...

397
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,776
To risk the wrath of the gods.

398
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:14,646
How will you ever get odin
to forgive you now?

399
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,718
They're here! Come and see!

400
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:14,405
Agh!

401
00:35:14,506 --> 00:35:16,908
They're empty.

402
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,993
Ungh!

403
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,765
Ungh!

404
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,004
Move back!

405
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,011
Fight back! Regroup!

406
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:30,281
<i>Stay together!</i>

407
00:36:31,884 --> 00:36:33,051
<i>Pull up!</i>

408
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:36,888
Aggghhhhh!

409
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:42,894
Ungh!

410
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:01,646
Ungh!

411
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:05,183
Aghhh!

412
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:11,155
Agghhh! Ungh!

413
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:18,796
- Agghhhh!
- Ungh!

414
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:28,673
Aggghhhhhhh! Agh! Odin!

415
00:37:28,774 --> 00:37:30,174
Aggghhhhhhh!

416
00:37:33,812 --> 00:37:35,680
Aggggghhhhhh!

417
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,959
Aggggghhhhhh!

418
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,594
Aggggghhhhhh!

419
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:52,597
Ungh!

420
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,437
Ungh!

421
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:02,640
Aggggghhh!

422
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:09,147
Noooo!

423
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,722
Aggghhhhh!

424
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,730
Agghhh!

425
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,669
Agghhh!

426
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:10,508
Aggghhhh! Ungh!

427
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:15,513
Aghhh!

428
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,516
Ungh!

429
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:22,687
Ungh!

430
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,628
<i>Agghhh!</i>

431
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:34,966
How many christians did I kill,
Floki?

432
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:37,568
How many?

433
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,006
Do you think odin
is still angry with me now?

434
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:03,664
Whew!

435
00:40:08,636 --> 00:40:11,805
It seems your brother
the king...

436
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:17,377
Does not care if you live
or die.

437
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,112
If you let me talk to him,

438
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,050
I will persuade him
to honor his pledge.

439
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:41,802
Why should I not...
Just kill you now?

440
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:48,308
Then you'll have nothing left
to bargain with.

441
00:40:50,245 --> 00:40:52,713
I have this.

442
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:10,163
<i>Open!</i>

443
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,399
<i>Open the gate!</i>

444
00:42:57,105 --> 00:43:00,273
<i>I swear before God almighty,</i>

445
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,676
I declare war eternal

446
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:05,912
on the Northman
Ragnar Lothbrok.

447
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:08,415
I swear to our lord
Jesus Christ

448
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:11,284
and to the blessed virgin

449
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:16,456
one day I will avenge myself
on him,

450
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:20,327
and bring him to justice
and to death,

451
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:23,630
so help me God.

452
