1
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,894
Previously on "Vikings..."

2
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:05,533
We have built a new boat.

3
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:08,068
For the first time, we can go west.

4
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:10,503
Countless riches await us.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,473
Our enemies are everywhere.

6
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,210
They cannot prevail.

7
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:16,080
The Earl knows
nothing about our new boat.

8
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:18,081
He could kill us
for disobeying his orders.

9
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:19,949
Have you got the balls to join us?

10
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:21,252
They have set sail.

11
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:22,819
They'll
never be heard from again.

12
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,222
What if Ragnar is right?

13
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:27,206
There are no lands to the west!

14
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,933
They've come. They're here.

15
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,462
Who is here?

16
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:33,001
Hell - and all its devils!

17
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,875
How do you speak our language?

18
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,041
Why have you not killed this one?

19
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,814
He is worth more alive.

20
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:44,048
Take what you will.
This is what we came for.

Hello!

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,841
You are Ragnar Lothbrok's son,

31
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,944
Bjorn.

32
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:47,943
I remember you from the thing.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,546
Yes.

34
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,316
Where is your father?

35
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:53,484
Bjorn? Who are you talking to?

36
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,556
I was just asking your son

37
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:01,528
where Ragnar Lothbrok might be?

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,097
He's gone fishing.

39
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:05,302
Oh! Fishing.

40
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:08,936
He's gone fishing.

41
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:12,250
Yes, fishing.

42
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,919
When will he return?

43
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,220
I don't know.

44
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:25,993
In which case I must
take someone back as surety,

45
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:26,966
just in case.

46
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,033
In case...?

47
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:35,073
In case your husband has not gone fishing!

48
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,992
You! Come!

49
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:52,496
Come!

50
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:04,312
You have to come with me.

51
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,549
If you don't obey this order,

52
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:10,188
the Earl will never give you an arm-ring!

53
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:13,191
I'll come.

54
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,562
Good.

55
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,864
Then let's be on our way.

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,534
What are you doing?
Where are you taking my son?

57
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,072
He'll be quite safe, woman.

58
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,946
I bid you all a good day.

59
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:47,033
We did it, brother.

60
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,540
Yes, brother, we did.

61
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,012
Let's just hope the Earl sees it that way.

62
00:04:58,386 --> 00:04:59,086
Yeah.

63
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:17,038
What is your name?

64
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:20,680
Athelstan.

65
00:05:20,713 --> 00:05:24,061
I am Ragnar Lothbrok.

66
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:28,866
What was that place called?

67
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:33,797
Lindisfarne.

68
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:35,027
England?

69
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:37,898
Yes.

70
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,407
It was foretold that divine punishment

71
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,642
would fall upon God's chosen people

72
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,913
for all our grievous sins,

73
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,450
and so it has happened.

74
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:55,525
And that is why I am here.

75
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,689
No.

76
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:02,031
You are here because I spared your life.

77
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,939
Why did you spare my life?

78
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,052
I don't know yet.

79
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:08,152
Ragnar Lothbrok!

80
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,053
What is it?

81
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:14,425
Brother Cenwulf here, beside me,

82
00:07:14,462 --> 00:07:15,861
I think he's dead.

83
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,445
You're right.

84
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,513
Leif.

85
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,989
May God rest your soul, brother Cenwulf.

86
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:05,992
E nomine patri, e filii,

87
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,534
et spiritus sancti. Amen.

88
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:12,667
Yeah!

89
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:14,914
We'll drink well tonight, my friend.

90
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,018
Ahhh.

91
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,598
Erik!

92
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,864
Oh, thank the gods!

93
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,866
And not alone! Look!

94
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,137
We've brought slaves to sell.

95
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,874
But there's more, woman.

96
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,807
More things of gold and silver

97
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:36,913
than you and I have ever seen before,

98
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,680
nor anyone else here in Kattegat.

99
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,594
Ragnar Lothbrok, welcome back.

100
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:53,666
We know you sailed west
across the open ocean

101
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,672
and found land and plunder,

102
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,439
as you promised.

103
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:01,208
So let no man say any more
that it is not possible,

104
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,582
and we salute and praise you.

105
00:10:27,813 --> 00:10:30,114
Knut. You're too late.

106
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,755
You missed the boat.

107
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:36,157
I came to tell you

108
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,627
that Earl Haraldson summons you

109
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,227
to attend him in the great hall.

110
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:45,135
It will be a pleasure.

111
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:48,840
Well done, Ragnar!

112
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:50,141
Are you coming, Knut?

113
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:25,522
My lord,

114
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,761
it was easy to take all of these things.

115
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,861
The priests in their temple,

116
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,865
they had no weapons.

117
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,803
They were like babies.

118
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:42,045
Here is one of their priests.

119
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,014
We captured several of
them to sell for slaves.

120
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:50,587
It must be true

121
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:54,557
that there are many more
such holy places in england

122
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:57,263
and other lands to the west

123
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,735
likewise filled with such treasure,

124
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:06,006
and to sail there will benefit us all.

125
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,959
How did you
find this place of great riches

126
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:22,561
when all before you had failed?

127
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,065
My lord,

128
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:30,905
we were more fortunate than others.

129
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:34,012
We had Thor on our side.

130
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,113
Thor. Thor. Thor.

131
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:40,587
Yes.

132
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,556
Then you were indeed fortunate.

133
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:49,592
But you understand that
all this belongs to me,

134
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:52,134
by right.

135
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:58,075
My lord, me and
Floki paid for the boat.

136
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,646
Surely we are entitled to... some reward,

137
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:03,051
and my crew...

138
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:05,619
You want me to pay you

139
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:09,823
when you took these things
as easily as from babies?

140
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,079
Here's
what I've decided to do...

141
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:32,886
Each one of you can take one thing

142
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,559
from this haul.

143
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,126
One?

144
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,928
Yes. And you'll still
be richer than you were before.

145
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,573
Now, all the world can see

146
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:50,076
how magnanimous and generous is your lord,

147
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:54,583
especially since you disobeyed me.

148
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,154
So, Ragnar Lothbrok,

149
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:03,929
what will you choose?

150
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:43,279
I will take the
priest for my slave.

151
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:48,691
The priest?

152
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:03,671
Granted.

153
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:14,653
Why did you do that?

154
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,758
Why did you give everything away so easily?

155
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,194
We wasted our time.

156
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:23,663
I never should have believed in you.

157
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:26,104
He was looking for
an excuse to kill us.

158
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:27,870
Why would we go to Valhalla

159
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:31,776
after such miserable and pointless deaths?

160
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,579
Brother, believe me,

161
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:39,152
this is not the end,
it's just the beginning.

162
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:52,639
Well...

163
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,640
At least we didn't give
everything away so easily.

164
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,610
That's your one thing?

165
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:03,016
How should he ever find out?

166
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:04,186
You idiot!

167
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:08,224
Would odin expect us to
do anything so stupid?

168
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:14,164
You have your odin and I have mine.

169
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,503
Why don't you go get drunk,

170
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,274
spend all this on whores.

171
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,545
Make sure the Earl really finds out

172
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:25,112
that you stole from him.

173
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:03,395
What a hoard is this!

174
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,787
What a hoard it is.

175
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:11,338
See what you've done, my lord?

176
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,208
Never doubt your power.

177
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:15,577
With just a few words,

178
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:19,585
you stripped Ragnar Lothbrok
of all his treasure.

179
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:22,389
He's nothing to you,

180
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,226
and you are all power,

181
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:28,384
all authority.

182
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,802
You can have whatever you want.

183
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,533
They told me you'd come home!

184
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,974
Father! You're home!

185
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:57,379
Little man...

186
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,120
Did you reach the west?

187
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,120
So...

188
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,561
Where's all the treasure you promised?

189
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,434
The Earl took it all for himself.

190
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:24,447
But I found it, and it filled the boat.

191
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:29,928
I believe you.

192
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,567
You ought to believe me.

193
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:35,541
This is a priest from
the temple to prove it.

194
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,881
Priest! This is my family.

195
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:40,492
His name is Athelstan.

196
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:45,934
Although he's a foreigner,
he speaks our language,

197
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:47,540
don't you?

198
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:48,612
A little, yes.

199
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,093
What is wrong with your head?

200
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:59,001
When we become monks, they cut our hair.

201
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,007
It marks us out.

202
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:04,981
If you're a priest,
which God do you like best?

203
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,258
There is only one God.

204
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,538
Here, you can touch him.

205
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,182
Are we keeping him?

206
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:17,317
Hello.

207
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:21,459
I've missed your smell and your body.

208
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,078
Why do you wear this?

209
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,551
All monks do.

210
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,570
Look at his feet.

211
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,624
Athelstan.

212
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:19,335
Athelstan, we want to ask you something.

213
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:26,562
Come and join us, priest.

214
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,667
Come on.

215
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,144
Don't you want to?

216
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,332
You'll enjoy it.

217
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:38,400
I am a monk.

218
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,542
I have taken vows of celibacy.

219
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:44,614
I cannot touch a woman.

220
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:47,892
I never have.

221
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:05,434
Wouldn't you like to?

222
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,418
It would be a sin.

223
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,659
Who would know?

224
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:17,738
God would know.

225
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:22,012
What if he looked the other way?

226
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:35,912
Go to sleep then... with your God.

227
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:49,197
Is this what you wanted?
There are so many...

228
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,849
Bjorn, where are you going?

229
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,152
Time for breakfast.

230
00:25:07,354 --> 00:25:08,921
What age are you, boy?

231
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,926
Thirteen.

232
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:13,397
Thirteen.

233
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,796
The age my boy would have been.

234
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:21,470
The men will soon be going
on the summer raids,

235
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,477
are you looking forward to joining them?

236
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:25,212
I dream of it.

237
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:29,516
I'm already a good fighter,
like my father was.

238
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:31,556
That's why I chose you,

239
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:34,258
because you're broad and strong.

240
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,675
That's deep enough.

241
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:48,415
Come.

242
00:26:10,616 --> 00:26:13,818
Why are you burying all this treasure?

243
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:15,854
Don't you know anything, boy?

244
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:17,757
Odin promises that
a man will have the use

245
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,292
of everything he has hoarded up

246
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,296
after he is dead

247
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,400
and wakes up again in Valhalla.

248
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:26,904
But the hoard needs protection,

249
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:29,206
somebody to look after it...

250
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:32,377
In this life... and the next.

251
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:43,494
You've already seen
enough of this life, boy.

252
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,762
Aghhh! Oh!

253
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:34,738
No more.

254
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:37,677
We don't like those in our house

255
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:39,810
to go hungry or thirsty.

256
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:53,331
I am very curious about england.

257
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:54,698
Does it have one king

258
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:57,403
who rules over the whole country?

259
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,781
There are four kingdoms

260
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:09,255
with four kings.

261
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:14,761
You landed in the kingdom of Northumbria.

262
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,602
The king of Northumbria is called Aelle.

263
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:23,476
He is a great king.

264
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:24,910
A powerful king.

265
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:28,684
Then why did his men not
protect your temple?

266
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:32,656
Before you came,

267
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,691
we had no need to protect our monastery.

268
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,832
We lived in peace.

269
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:42,669
Everyone respected it as a place of God.

270
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:49,244
Why does your God need
silver and gold, hmm?

271
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:53,854
He must be greedy...

272
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:56,591
Like loki!

273
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:00,594
We have greedy gods too.

274
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,870
My God is not greedy.

275
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:09,311
His kingdom is not of this world.

276
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,848
Then why is his kingdom
so full of treasure?

277
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,052
Christian people give away their riches

278
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:20,293
to the churches and monasteries

279
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,630
in order to save their souls.

280
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,737
What are their souls?

281
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:37,386
I want to learn some of your language.

282
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:42,057
Will you teach me, priest?

283
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,324
You. Come.

284
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:34,504
Ragnar Lothbrok.

285
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,373
My lord.

286
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:38,472
And how do you find your new slave?

287
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:40,678
Hmm...

288
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:44,714
I find him very useful,
as you will discover.

289
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:48,355
So what do you want?

290
00:30:48,357 --> 00:30:50,758
I want to sail west again.

291
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:52,462
I have spoken at great lengths

292
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,767
with my Christian slave.

293
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,401
He is not a stupid person,

294
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:59,804
however stupid his God is.

295
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:01,674
He has traveled a great deal,

296
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,775
and he has told me

297
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:06,016
that there are many countries to the west.

298
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:09,053
He has also told me about his england,

299
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:12,983
about his kings and his customs.

300
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,274
And what are
we to do with his customs?

301
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,242
He has informed me of a large town,

302
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,948
near to the temple that we raided before.

303
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:24,117
And in this town there are other temples,

304
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:26,055
and surely other riches.

305
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:30,223
No! I was lying!
There's nothing there!

306
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:32,195
Shhh!

307
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,099
You see?

308
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:37,005
This town is clearly worth a visit.

309
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:40,978
Give us back our boat.

310
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:43,178
Let us go there and find out.

311
00:31:43,215 --> 00:31:45,249
What do you have to lose?

312
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,987
Any plunder we take will
be yours to do with

313
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:49,354
as you please.

314
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:50,458
I could go there myself.

315
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,293
Ragnar yes, you could, my lord,

316
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,731
but why put yourself in danger?

317
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,032
Why not leave it to someone

318
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:01,473
who has more... experience of this journey,

319
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:05,747
and someone who is more expendable?

320
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,103
Very well.

321
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,310
I sanction this raid... on one condition:

322
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:29,912
A warrior I trust goes with you.

323
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,282
Knut.

324
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,055
You will go with him for my sake.

325
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,961
Trust me, lord.

326
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:41,797
I will take very close
care of your interests.

327
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:47,207
O lord, forgive
me for what I have done.

328
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:48,775
You will not regret this.

329
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:03,265
He's found a new way to navigate the sea.

330
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:06,535
Find out what it is.

331
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,852
Run away if you want.

332
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:13,098
I have the Earl's
permission to sail back to england.

333
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,103
I want to leave as soon as possible.

334
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,147
How soon is that?

335
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,484
Tomorrow.

336
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:31,959
We all wish you success.

337
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,466
We will sacrifice to odin.

338
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:41,073
Are you not coming?

339
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:43,947
What?

340
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,318
I want you to come with me.

341
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,394
But the farm, the children.

342
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,963
Bjorn is still too young,

343
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:01,274
although he can help on the farm.

344
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,074
But who is to be in charge?

345
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:06,412
The priest.

346
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:08,382
I will leave him with a key.

347
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:11,887
Father! You cannot place a slave above me,

348
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:13,224
your natural son.

349
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:19,265
I don't regard him as a slave.

350
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:21,068
He's a responsible person.

351
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:24,372
Please, Ragnar Lothbrok,

352
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,143
don't do this.

353
00:35:28,312 --> 00:35:31,147
What do you think, Gyda?

354
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:33,251
I don't mind. I like the priest.

355
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:36,557
Then it is decided.

356
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:53,916
If any harm befalls my children,

357
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:58,921
I will tear the lungs out
of your body, priest.

358
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:32,142
Oof! Agh

359
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:53,017
Are you really with us?

360
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,956
Understand this!

361
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,952
A war band lives...

362
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:03,226
And dies together.

363
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:08,398
If you cannot trust the men
to either side of you,

364
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,362
or in front of you,

365
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,266
you are already a dead man.

366
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,269
I am with you.

367
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,941
I made a mistake before
- I did not come with you.

368
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:32,908
Now I fear odin will make
a bad judgment of me.

369
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,577
For me, that's as important
as it is for you.

370
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,013
Just wanted to ask.

371
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,407
Ungh!

372
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:03,882
Ragnar!
