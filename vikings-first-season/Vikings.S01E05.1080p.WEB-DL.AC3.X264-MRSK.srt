1
00:00:01,516 --> 00:00:05,184
But I don't see Knut. Where is he?

2
00:00:05,186 --> 00:00:06,285
I killed him.

3
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:08,087
He tried to rape my wife.

4
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,121
Arrest him.

5
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:10,956
My Lord, for you wife Siggy,

6
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,158
would have you not done the same?

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,026
Ragnar Lothbrok can give you nothing,

8
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:16,028
I on the other hand can
give you a great deal.

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,429
This is my daughter, Thyri.

10
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,165
She's soon to get married,

11
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,066
and I must think very carefully

12
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:22,368
about her future husband.

13
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,805
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.

14
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:30,843
What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.

15
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:32,912
So unfortunately you cannot punish him.

16
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:34,313
Ragnar Lothbrok.

17
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:36,081
I am unarmed.

18
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,217
Does he desire to be Earl?

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,386
He searches for you death.

20
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,855
Consults the gods.

21
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:44,056
I know what he's doing.

22
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,324
He's preparing himself.

23
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:35,307

24
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,433
May the gods protect you. Always.

25
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,069
Thank you, My Lord.

26
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:06,005
I hope your boy brings you profit.

27
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,506
That's the last one, My Lord.

28
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,276
Thank you.

29
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:55,421
May I ask you something?

30
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,524
Am I still your slave?

31
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:02,294
Does it matter?

32
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:04,463
It matters because I have
noticed that in your world,

33
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:08,267
slaves are often treated worse than dogs.

34
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,202
Do I treat you like a dog?

35
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,537
That's not my point.

36
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:14,340
Legally you could beat me to death,

37
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,241
and there would be no penalty.

38
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:20,079
But everyone else in your
world is subject to the law.

39
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:24,616
A man can rape his female
slave but not a free woman.

40
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:27,286
It is true that we distinguish

41
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:29,455
between those captured in battle,

42
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:32,458
and our own free men and women.

43
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,362
In any case, why do you say "your world"?

44
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:37,563
You live here now,

45
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,566
this is your world

46
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:45,437
and I've never seen you try to escape.

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,242
I am less and less
interested in escaping now.

48
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,577
Even if I could.

49
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,553
But I would like to be a free man.

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,259
If it matters so much to you.

51
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,560
It does.

52
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,672
What are you preparing for?

53
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:23,609
What do you mean?

54
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,644
I've watched you.

55
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:28,180
You are about to do something.

56
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:31,216
You have made yourself very strong.

57
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:34,586
Perhaps not strong enough.

58
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:39,091
What do the gods say?

59
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:45,197
What do you know about our gods, priest?

60
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:51,136
Finish the fish.

61
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:55,140
In silence.

62
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:52,724
Let the man who thinks that
he has descended from the gods,

63
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,627
learn that he is human after all.

64
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,476
We're under attack.

65
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,544
Gyda. Bjorn.

66
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:15,781
Get Bjorn.

67
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:20,352
Take this. Stay back.

68
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,822
Athelstan...

69
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,799
Take this.

70
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:37,703
What shall we do?

71
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:38,804
Should we run?

72
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,372
No, we stay.

73
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:41,573
Your father will be back.

74
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:43,242
But there are too many of them.

75
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,611
Stay strong. Be ready.

76
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:53,372
He's in the house, My Lord!

77
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,940
Father!

78
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,710
You're hurt.

79
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,612
We have to go now.

80
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,950
What's happening?

81
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,451
Father please tell me?

82
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,553
We have to get to the boat.

83
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,422
- Are you coming?
- Go.

84
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:12,424
Quickly, Gyda! Come on, boy.

85
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:13,625
Father, I won't go without you.

86
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:14,993
Boy, don't argue!

87
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,829
Father, I don't want to go without you.

88
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,904
Ragnar Lothbrok!

89
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,709
I'm right behind you. Now go.

90
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,878
Go on, quick. Go, boy, go.

91
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,584
Ragnar Lothbrok! Show yourself!

92
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,659
Show yourself!

93
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,880
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

94
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:51,656
Come on. Come on.

95
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:56,895
Help! Help!

96
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,938
Do you accept that you are a criminal?

97
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:11,910
That you are only worthy only of defeat,

98
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,979
worthy only of death.

99
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,051
I accept my fate.

100
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,857
Let me speak with my God.

101
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:54,152
Get down!

102
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:57,722
Hurry!

103
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:03,995
Odin,

104
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,169
Lord of Lords,

105
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,707
Father, help me.

106
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:26,952
After him.

107
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,790
Burn the house!

108
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:32,958
Bring him back alive.

109
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,793
Yes, Lord.

110
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,828
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

111
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,207
There!

112
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:46,891
There he is.

113
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,313
Where is he?

114
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,116
Can you see him?

115
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:12,317
Where is Father?

116
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,953
He's there somewhere.

117
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,193
Where are they?

118
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,898
Father!

119
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:31,870
Is he dead?

120
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:33,404
He's dead, isn't he?

121
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:35,874
He's dead!

122
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,408
Is he dead?

123
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,211
I don't know, Lord.

124
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,848
Seize his boat.

125
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,883
Yes, Lord.

126
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:46,050
He's a criminal.

127
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,786
He's not entitled to property.

128
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:50,955
Bring them here so we can talk to them.

129
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:53,124
Yes, Lord Haraldson.

130
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:54,325
You let him escape.

131
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,361
I will not forget that.

132
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:17,248
Floki!

133
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,251
Floki!

134
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:22,253
Floki!

135
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:27,158
Who are you?

136
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,994
I must speak with Floki. Is he here?

137
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,096
Bjorn?

138
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:34,132
My father is dying.

139
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:39,137
Helga, get the bark of the ash,

140
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,473
and the garlic and the sage.

141
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,309
Get the sage.

142
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:47,345
We make a paste to put on the wounds.

143
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,347
But first we must clean them.

144
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,449
And the only way to make
them clean is with fire.

145
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:54,319
Bjorn, get more logs back there.

146
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,422
A knife...

147
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:18,343
We must bid welcome to our guest.

148
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,145
Guest? You didn't tell
me to expect a guest!

149
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:22,914
This is Earl Bjarni.

150
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,383
He is a Swede.

151
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:28,419
This is my wife Siggy

152
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:32,190
and my daughter Thyri.

153
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:38,296
You are welcome, My Lord.

154
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:43,101
Thank you. It was a very
hard crossing, I must say.

155
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:44,402
You're right.

156
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:47,438
She's very pretty, My Lord Haraldson.

157
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:52,410
Come, feast with us.

158
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,412
Sit over here.

159
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:58,049
So that you may get to know
each other a little bit better.

160
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,551
Forgive me,

161
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:04,022
but why would they get
to know each other better?

162
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:09,060
Because they are being married.

163
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,966
- But he's...
- It's arranged.

164
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,369
May I?

165
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:29,013
You will have no regrets, my dear child.

166
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:32,183
And you will provide me with many sons,

167
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:35,053
of that I am quite certain.

168
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,456
The celebration, shall be later this year,

169
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,559
when I shall return, laden with gifts.

170
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,528
In the meantime,

171
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,199
please accept this as
a token of my affection.

172
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,103
Here, let me.

173
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:05,116
What do you say, Thyri?

174
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:07,318
Thank you, My Lord.

175
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:10,154
You are very... kind.

176
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:19,364
Give that to me.

177
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:27,572
I dedicate this blade to the goddess.

178
00:20:28,507 --> 00:20:31,376
To Freya.

179
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,444
Wisdom might you give us, Freya,

180
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:38,082
and healing hands while we live.

181
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:40,385
Hail to the aesir.

182
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:43,421
Please Freya, heal my father.

183
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,264
For everything there is a season,

184
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:56,267
and a time for every matter under the sun.

185
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,503
A time to be born, a time to die;

186
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,140
a time to plant,

187
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:04,275
and to pluck up what is planted;

188
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,377
a time to kill, and a time to heal...

189
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,282
Mary mother of God, listen to me:

190
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:13,151
Do no let this man die.

191
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,527
How could you?

192
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,562
It's an excellent match.

193
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:27,231
He's a powerful man,

194
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,133
and he's the cousin of King Horik.

195
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:34,172
You don't judge a man by the way he looks.

196
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:39,410
We've struck a good deal.

197
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:41,345
He'll give us twenty
pounds of silver for her.

198
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,552
Don't you care for her happiness?

199
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:50,621
I care for her security, and her future...

200
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:52,557
and ours.

201
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:56,360
This marriage will bring us land

202
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:58,663
and important alliances.

203
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,568
The gods have seen that we need them.

204
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,305
You told me nothing of this marriage.

205
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:10,241
You have treated me with utter contempt.

206
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:12,677
You don't care.

207
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:21,352
I stopped caring about a lot of things...

208
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:23,654
when our boys were murdered.

209
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:28,292
They died... you buried them.

210
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:30,495
And for you, it was the end of the matter.

211
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:31,696
But for me!

212
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,600
They were my sons.

213
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:38,202
I bore them.

214
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,504
I brought them into this world.

215
00:22:39,506 --> 00:22:41,239
I watched them as they grew.

216
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:44,675
And I loved them, just as I loved you.

217
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:55,520
The killers,

218
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:58,289
they dug a shallow grave.

219
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:03,361
And before they buried them,

220
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:09,433
they cut their heads off.

221
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:15,406
And when they laid them
in the ground, they...

222
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,413
they put their faces against their asses

223
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:26,384
as a sign of disrespect.

224
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,356
If I ever find the men
who did that... I will...

225
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:48,739
I took these locks of
hair from their heads.

226
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,487
See Siggy,

227
00:24:04,756 --> 00:24:07,625
when you have such knowledge,

228
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:11,762
being married to a rich,
old man isn't so bad.

229
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,856
Is it true he's here?

230
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,302
He's still weak...

231
00:25:24,304 --> 00:25:26,504
but his wounds are beginning to heal,

232
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:27,872
thanks to Floki's magic.

233
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:30,708
Torstein.

234
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,610
Ragnar, see who's here.

235
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:36,547
Ragnar, my friend...

236
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,882
How are you?

237
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,684
Save me from these people.

238
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:47,558
How did you know I was here?

239
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,393
I didn't.

240
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:52,463
I only know Earl Haraldson
is looking for you.

241
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:54,865
It was Rollo who said that if you're alive,

242
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,901
you might be here.

243
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:00,738
Then why did he not come himself?

244
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,540
Because he thought the Earl's men

245
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:05,743
would be looking for him especially.

246
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:10,581
It is no secret that all of
the crew are being watched.

247
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,483
But I made sure no-one followed me.

248
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,620
Let's eat.

249
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:18,756
It is good to see you.

250
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,991
You too, my friend.

251
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,702
This is Helga.

252
00:26:31,704 --> 00:26:32,770
Hello Helga.

253
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:41,679
Oh, don't wiggle your maggot in her face.

254
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:43,481
She's taken.

255
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,551
Sit down.

256
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:53,391
I heard they burned down your farm.

257
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:55,526
They also slaughtered all our livestock.

258
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,027
We have nothing left.

259
00:26:57,996 --> 00:26:59,997
You are alive.

260
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,699
Ragnar is alive.

261
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,803
Your children are alive.

262
00:27:05,805 --> 00:27:07,772
You have everything left.

263
00:27:07,774 --> 00:27:10,007
We also need to eat.

264
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:14,979
And we are already eating some
of your winter supplies, Floki.

265
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:17,548
And I am ashamed.

266
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,451
The gods will provide.

267
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:28,726
For everything there is a season,

268
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,061
and a time for every matter under heaven:

269
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:33,764
A time to be born, and a time to die...

270
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,872
Just eat your soup, priest.

271
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,611
Sometimes your God sounds
a lot like one of ours.

272
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,906
Why did the gods keep me alive?

273
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:22,613
That is the question I keep asking myself.

274
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,586
What are you going to do?

275
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,922
I can do nothing until I am well.

276
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:37,928
Where's the boat?

277
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:43,834
Haraldson has confiscated the boat.

278
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:46,904
His daughter is getting
married to man from Svealand.

279
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:48,672
The boat is her dowry.

280
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:55,613
Floki can always build us another one.

281
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:03,954
And the Earl?

282
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:09,960
Pssst!

283
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,596
Come on.

284
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:15,032
<font color="#804040">Torstein:</font> What for?

285
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,901
If you don't come now,

286
00:29:16,903 --> 00:29:19,103
I promise, you will regret it.

287
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,262
I don't remember inviting you

288
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:54,264
to my daughter's wedding.

289
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:56,166
Well, My Lord, I assumed
you'd just forgotten.

290
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,202
So I came anyway.

291
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:03,874
Here's to happiness for your daughter

292
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:06,076
and may she be blessed with many sons.

293
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:12,850
That could be you

294
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,918
dancing with my daughter.

295
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,956
I often think about it.

296
00:31:19,924 --> 00:31:22,092
Still I was not fated to marry her.

297
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:26,764
I think that that old man was.

298
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:28,766
Why are you here?

299
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,268
We should talk.

300
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:43,981
Silence! Silence!

301
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:51,855
Earl Haraldson it is
time for husband and wife

302
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:54,258
to go to the matrimonial chamber.

303
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,756
So, what do you want to talk about?

304
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:28,092
I don't want your thugs,
like these fellows,

305
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,227
following me around everywhere.

306
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:31,929
It's a waste of everyone's time.

307
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,797
Oh, I disagree.

308
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,967
If you lead them to Ragnar Lothbrok

309
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:39,369
it will be time well spent.

310
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:41,305
Ragnar is dead.

311
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:46,810
Do you swear that on your arm-ring?

312
00:32:46,812 --> 00:32:47,845
No.

313
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:52,015
I cannot swear because
I have not seen a body.

314
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:54,284
But I have heard nothing,
and he is my brother.

315
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,955
I am sure in my heart he is dead.

316
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:00,891
What about his wife and children?

317
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,126
They too have disappeared.

318
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:04,128
So I heard.

319
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,930
That you had them killed,frankly.

320
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:09,399
By these fellows there.

321
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:11,969
So why should I trust you,

322
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:14,037
because you've already betrayed me.

323
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,405
I didn't betray you.

324
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,341
I told the truth.

325
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:20,811
Shouldn't you trust
someone who tells the truth?

326
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:22,012
So tell me the truth now!

327
00:33:22,014 --> 00:33:23,781
The truth is, you run everything here.

328
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:24,948
You own the ships.

329
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,050
You decide where it is we raid.

330
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:29,119
I need to be part of that.

331
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:31,288
I don't want to be on the outside.

332
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,224
I want to raid and fight.

333
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:38,228
It's what I was born to do.

334
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,231
I understand.

335
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,968
And you must understand

336
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,006
it will take time for me to trust you.

337
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:51,942
And I do not give my trust easily.

338
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,380
But you can stay here, eat at my expense,

339
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,017
work on my boats,

340
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:01,852
prepare for the season.

341
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,921
Then we shall see.

342
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:06,390
Agreed?

343
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,927
Agreed.

344
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,096
Good.

345
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,117
So if Odin lives in Valhalla,

346
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,354
is he the only God who
lives in a great hall?

347
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,359
No, there are many halls.

348
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:46,296
Thor lives in Thrudheim.

349
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:49,366
And Frey was given the hall at Alfheim

350
00:34:49,368 --> 00:34:52,236
when he cut his first tooth!

351
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:54,438
And nearby is Valhalla,

352
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,876
vast and gold-bright.

353
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:00,177
And every day,

354
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:03,046
Odin chooses slain men to join him.

355
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,183
They arm themselves

356
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:08,418
and fight in the courtyard.

357
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:11,521
They kill one another;

358
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:14,324
but every night they rise again,

359
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:19,162
and ride back to the hall, and feast.

360
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:23,267
The roof is made out of shields.

361
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:26,003
The rafters are Spears.

362
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:29,106
Coats of mail litter the benches.

363
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:30,941
A wolf stands at the Western door

364
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:35,379
and an eagle hovers above it.

365
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:40,083
It has five hundred and forty doors,

366
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,085
and when Ragnarok comes,

367
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:46,356
eight hundred warriors
will march out of each door,

368
00:35:48,026 --> 00:35:49,459
shoulder to shoulder.

369
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:53,130
What is Ragnarok?

370
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:03,340
Well then: How was the Earth created?

371
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:11,315
The Earth was made from the Ymir's flesh

372
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:13,050
and oceans from his blood,

373
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,053
when the titan was thawed from the ice.

374
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:18,455
The gods, they made hills out of his bones,

375
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,193
and trees from his hairs,

376
00:36:23,195 --> 00:36:25,228
and the sky dome is his skull.

377
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:28,398
And out of his brain

378
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,501
they shaped the welling dark clouds.

379
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:40,010
So, how do you think it was made, priest?

380
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:18,648
Siggy.

381
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:29,426
No...

382
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,562
I was sure!

383
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:36,400
I've come to warn you:

384
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:38,468
You must leave at once. Today.

385
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:42,639
My husband he hates you.

386
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:45,108
He has shown me nothing but respect

387
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,276
since I came here.

388
00:37:46,278 --> 00:37:49,212
Rollo, believe me. Get away.

389
00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:44,261
Where's Ragnar Lothbrok?

390
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:51,501
Where is he?

391
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,539
He's dead.

392
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:56,773
Are you sure?

393
00:40:00,412 --> 00:40:01,945
You said you always tell the truth.

394
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:12,455
You seem to have a little
trouble opening your mouth.

395
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:20,297
Perhaps I could make that
a little easier for you.

396
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,462
When will you be better?

397
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:55,298
It's taken too long already.

398
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,867
In a few weeks' time your
father's wounds will be healed.

399
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,870
If he is careful.

400
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:04,507
You must have patience, Father.

401
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:06,710
You must have patience, Father.

402
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:08,678
Shut-up.

403
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,286
Bjorn Torstein!

404
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:20,290
I found him wandering around the marshes.

405
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,791
I was lost.

406
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:27,664
I was visited in great secrecy

407
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,666
by Earl Haraldson's wife, Siggy.

408
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:35,505
She told me that her husband
had played a trick on rollo,

409
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,844
and imprisoned him, trying
to find where you were.

410
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:45,849
Then he tortured him.

411
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:54,357
He tortured my brother?

412
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,560
Yes.

413
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,465
Siggy is sure,

414
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:04,467
her husband means to kill him

415
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:07,304
because rollo will not,

416
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:09,739
in any way, admit to where you are.

417
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,442
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.

418
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:56,519
Floki,

419
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:06,830
I have another favor to ask you.

420
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,468
I want you to go in to Kattegat.

421
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,002
I want you to ask for
a meeting with the Earl.

422
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:14,738
And when you meet him,

423
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,607
challenge him to a personal combat.

424
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:19,008
With me.

425
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:23,913
Tell him, if he refuses

426
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:26,750
shame will stalk him
for the rest of his life,

427
00:43:26,752 --> 00:43:29,519
and Odin will never
permit him into Valhalla.

428
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:32,522
