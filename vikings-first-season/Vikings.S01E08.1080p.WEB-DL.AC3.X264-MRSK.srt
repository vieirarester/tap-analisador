00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:05,644
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,705
Hail, Earl Ragnar!

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,837
The seer prophesized that your
father would have many sons.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,453
I'm with child again.

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,074
I know you're a boy - my son.

7
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:19,424
Lord Ragnar, I have come to swear
my allegiance to you and your family.

8
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,438
Leif, you are my friend.

9
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,879
- I would like to be a free man.
- Does it matter?

10
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:26,009
Everyone else in your
world is subject to the law.

11
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:27,733
Why do you say, "your world"?

12
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:30,385
<i>You live here now.</i>
<i>This is your world.</i>

13
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,364
You were once
married to an Earl,

14
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:34,433
would you not like to be married
to another one?

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,244
- Who?
- Me.

16
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:38,950
The gods desire
you to have a great future,

17
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,740
<i>but they can withdraw</i>
<i>their good will at any time.</i>

18
00:00:42,856 --> 00:00:46,125
<i>Our lives are fated,
we all have to accept that.</i>

Every nine years,

29
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:04,274
we travel to the temple
at Uppsala,

30
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:10,575
to give thanks to the gods and to offer
them sacrifices for all they do for us.

31
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:14,434
For protecting us,
for the success in battle,

32
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:17,886
<i>for the rains that they bring</i>
<i>that grow our crops</i>

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,953
and, of course,

34
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:22,721
for our children.

35
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:28,555
<i>This year</i>
<i>I was not going to go,</i>

36
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:31,868
for there is too much to do
around here.

37
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,282
Then my unborn son...

38
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,642
was cruelly taken from me,

39
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:46,017
and it made me wonder
what I had done

40
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,321
<i>to anger the gods.</i>

41
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:03,622
What do Christians do
about such pain?

42
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,772
In the Bible, it says that
all sorrows will pass.

43
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,419
In any case,

44
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,507
I've decided to go.

45
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm going to take the children
for the first time,

46
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,678
for it's important
that they go.

47
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,805
What about you?

48
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,913
Me?

49
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,759
- What about me?
- Will you come with us?

50
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:37,504
<i>Perhaps you would prefer</i>
<i>to stay here</i>

51
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,325
and worship your own God.

52
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:49,285
No, I'll gladly come with you.

53
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,724
Good.

54
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:54,771
I would have taken you anyway.

55
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,184
A gift for the
gods, for the children.

56
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:11,187
<i>Pray for my
daughter's recovery.</i>

57
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,819
A gift for the gods.

58
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,901
Pray for health and prosperity.

59
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,199
<i>My gift for the gods.</i>

60
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,480
<i>I ask their blessings</i>
<i>for my son.</i>

61
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:37,221
Gyda, you take the offerings.

62
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,880
For the gods in
thanks for my new baby.

63
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,647
Thank you.

64
00:04:45,457 --> 00:04:47,258
Ragnar...

65
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,595
Are you not happy
that we're going to Uppsala?

66
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:54,940
Of course I'm happy.

67
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:59,371
Why should I not be happy?

68
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,753
When we reach Uppsala,

69
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:06,844
we shall ask the gods
why they give with one hand,

70
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,531
but take away with the other?

71
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:14,193
Why they make me Earl,
yet kill my son?

72
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,590
We can have more sons.

73
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:22,081
Have we not tried?

74
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:06,338
Arne.

75
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,680
<i>Gyda, step up.</i>

76
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:17,803
<i>Careful.</i>

77
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,598
Ragnar.

78
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:00,426
Uppsala!

79
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,085
Floki!

80
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,713
Does he know?

81
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:54,117
No.

82
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:41,439
Hail to the
Aesir and the Vanir.

83
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,277
Hail to the gods and goddesses.

84
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:48,181
Hail to Odin, Thor, and frey.

85
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:51,748
Hail to Vali, Sif,
and Heimdall.

86
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:56,262
Hail to Balder, Bragi, and Eir.

87
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:59,721
Hail to Freja, Loki, and Frigg.

88
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:03,250
Hail to Lin, Ifon, and Mimir.

89
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,606
<i>Hail to Njord, Ran, and Tyr.</i>

90
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:12,103
Hail to Odin's spear,
Thor's hammer.

91
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:15,417
Hail to the mighty
fecund earth.

92
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:17,280
All...

93
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,199
All hail.

94
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:22,426
<i>All hail.</i>

95
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,321
All hail.

96
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:36,599
You know who
that is, don't you?

97
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:38,765
Of course.

98
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:42,515
This is Thor,
holding his hammer, Mjollnir.

99
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,266
Who hasn't heard him beating
his anvil in the storm?

100
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,468
Who doesn't believe in
mighty Thor,

101
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:50,409
slayer of frost and fire?

102
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,998
<i>Freja, Loki, and Frigg.</i>

103
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:56,101
<i>Hail to Lin, Ifon, and Mimir.</i>

104
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:59,668
<i>Hail to Njord, Ran, and Tyr.</i>

105
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,021
<i>Hail to Odin...</i>

106
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,081
Frey, Lord,

107
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:09,703
fill me with seed
and give me a son.

108
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,896
Do as you will with me,

109
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,175
make me blind
or deaf if you want to,

110
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,662
but give me a son

111
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:21,124
before it's too late.

112
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:25,151
<i>- Hail to...</i>
<i>- All hail.</i>

113
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:31,537
<i>Hail to Freja, Loki, and Frigg.</i>

114
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:34,873
Odin, father.

115
00:10:34,905 --> 00:10:37,507
<i>I have come to ask</i>
<i>for your love.</i>

116
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,736
<i>I want to grow and to prosper,</i>

117
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,817
<i>to quicken and be wise.</i>
<i>Hear me, Lord.</i>

118
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,277
<i>All hail.</i>

119
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,485
<i>Hail to the
Aesir and the Vanir.</i>

120
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:53,156
<i>Hail to the gods</i>
<i>and goddesses...</i>

121
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,767
<i>Lord of lords,</i>

122
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,478
father,

123
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,052
hear my prayer.

124
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:06,116
Let me understand your will.

125
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:10,783
<i>Is it true that I shall</i>
<i>have more sons</i>

126
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,806
like the seer says?

127
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:19,258
Accept the sacrifice
I plan to offer you...

128
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,413
And then answer me.

129
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:27,964
<i>Hail to the Aesir
and the Vanir.</i>

130
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:31,016
<i>Hail to the gods</i>
<i>and goddesses...</i>

131
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,986
<i>Hail to Odin, Thor...</i>

132
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:35,850
Who will bear me my son?

133
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:38,180
<i>Sif, and Heimdall.</i>

134
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:41,389
<i>Hail to Balder, Bragi, and Eir.</i>

135
00:11:42,478 --> 00:11:45,480
<i>Hail to Freja, Loki, and Frigg.</i>

136
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,208
How good is this, Rollo?

137
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,282
Especially because
we're here together.

138
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:55,090
Yes,

139
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,594
while we're here in Uppsala let us
enjoy and revel in every moment.

140
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,480
Have you been here before,
Helga?

141
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:11,109
No.

142
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,162
Do you know what happens here?

143
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,025
I've heard some stories.

144
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:17,432
<i>And they're all true.</i>

145
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,889
But they still don't prepare you
for what really happens here.

146
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:25,985
I can't wait to find out.

147
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,988
When is the food ready, Helga?

148
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:31,990
I'm hungry.

149
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:35,006
You're always hungry.

150
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,239
Of course I am...

151
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,476
but not always for food.

152
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,568
Can you feel it, Gyda?

153
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:55,589
Can you sense the presence
of the gods gathering here?

154
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:58,317
They have left
their bright halls to see us.

155
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,802
They are here for sure.

156
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:02,374
<i>They walk among us.</i>

157
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:04,703
And make their judgments on us.

158
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:08,165
So when do we offer
our sacrifices?

159
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,397
At the end of the festival.

160
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:13,064
<i>And in the meantime,
we celebrate the gods</i>

161
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,325
<i>and enjoy their presence</i>
<i>in any way we can.</i>

162
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,249
Give Athelstan a drink.

163
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,437
Priest... your cup.

164
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,624
<i>Mother, you came here before?</i>

165
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:34,973
Once.

166
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:37,518
And did you ask the gods
for anything?

167
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,336
Yes.

168
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,147
And they granted
my every desire.

169
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,779
What is this?

170
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,204
These will all be killed
as sacrifices.

171
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:26,804
Six, seven, eight, nine.

172
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:28,288
<i>Seven, eight, nine.</i>

173
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,639
And nine goats, and nine pigs.

174
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:32,159
There's nine of everything!

175
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,896
Yes,

176
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,348
nine of every kind.

177
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:41,212
And this?

178
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:45,374
It's for all the humans
that have been chosen.

179
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:15,225
Come join us, priest.

180
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,148
Drink.

181
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,479
Drink to the nights
and to the gods.

182
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,302
And, uh,

183
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:34,427
eat these.

184
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:35,304
I heard a rumor today that King
Horik himself may attend the festival.

185
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,773
It is not a rumor.

186
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:43,187
I desire to meet him.

187
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:48,558
There are great stories
and legends told about him.

188
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,641
Thank you.

189
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:12,054
You want to go out there,
don't you?

190
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,402
Please stay.

191
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,963
Why can't you stay?

192
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:49,669
<i>Priest...</i>

193
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:11,041
You are surely
not tired, Athelstan.

194
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:15,080
<i>Not on this great journey</i>
<i>you have begun,</i>

195
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,556
and must finish.

196
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:24,698
Leif...

197
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,809
If you let me go
I will fall again.

198
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:30,194
No,

199
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:32,494
the gods will hold you.

200
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,135
Priest,

201
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:04,569
I have been waiting for you.

202
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,382
Gyda, what is it, child?

203
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,521
I am bleeding.

204
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,140
Then you are no longer a child.

205
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,781
Forgive me.

206
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,714
You are a woman.

207
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:13,069
But let me cradle you
in my arms a last time,

208
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:15,817
as I always used to do.

209
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:21,177
It is hard for me
to let go of you.

210
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,867
Why do you do this, Thyri?

211
00:23:00,116 --> 00:23:02,413
Don't you understand?

212
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,083
I have to.

213
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:02,088
Priests, stir yourselves!

214
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:04,406
- You ignorant peasant!
- Wake up!

215
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:06,134
- How dare you disturb us?!
- Wake up!

216
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,427
Get out!

217
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:09,538
Get out of the temple!

218
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:11,468
<i>Priests!</i>

219
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:15,021
If you value your lives,
stop this at once.

220
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:17,957
Fools! This is King Horik.

221
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:45,907
Athelstan,

222
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,645
I want you to meet someone.

223
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:06,397
Ha! Ha! You
must be Ragnar Lothbrok!

224
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:12,135
I must tell you it is
my privilege and pleasure

225
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,768
to clap eyes on you.

226
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:16,212
Your reputation goes ahead
of you, Ragnar Lothbrok.

227
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:19,581
I know this because
so many have told me

228
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:22,147
how you killed Earl Haraldson

229
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,168
and then built
a new kind of ship...

230
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,950
were the first to sail west

231
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,813
and defeated a King of England!

232
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:32,860
In fact,
I can hardly believe my eyes

233
00:25:32,904 --> 00:25:36,507
that you are standing right here
in front of me.

234
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:38,824
Please, please.

235
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,880
Travelers and
storytellers have described

236
00:25:43,892 --> 00:25:45,819
how you came to your throne

237
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,846
by defeating, one by one,

238
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:49,668
the six uncles
that killed your father.

239
00:25:49,687 --> 00:25:51,657
And my mother,

240
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:54,980
and all my sisters
and brothers.

241
00:25:56,064 --> 00:26:00,054
I also know how you
favor the poets at your court,

242
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:03,167
and your people respect
your law making,

243
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,138
your justice, and your rule.

244
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:07,883
And as a consequence, here,

245
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,165
on this site,

246
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,054
in the living presence
of the gods,

247
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:17,773
I offer you my fealty

248
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:22,053
and my service.

249
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,812
I accept your pledge,
with a glad heart.

250
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:37,282
What can I do for you in return?

251
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:41,671
You could join forces with me.

252
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:46,086
I am not satisfied with what
I have achieved so far.

253
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:50,335
I want to send bigger
raiding parties to the west;

254
00:26:50,672 --> 00:26:52,106
Yes, to plunder,

255
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:55,033
but also to explore new lands.

256
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,428
There are other lands
to the west?

257
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:00,024
There is a kingdom
called Frankia...

258
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:03,105
a kingdom far larger,
far richer,

259
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:06,165
and far more powerful
than England.

260
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:08,858
Athelstan, come.

261
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:12,670
<i>Come.</i>

262
00:27:13,996 --> 00:27:15,962
This man has seen it.

263
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:19,835
I was a
Christian monk in England.

264
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:23,357
I traveled to other lands
as a missionary.

265
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:26,097
I have heard of Christians,

266
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,031
<i>and of their God.</i>

267
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:31,696
And are you still a Christian?

268
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,426
No.

269
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,678
Of course not!

270
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:39,172
How could you be a Christian
and walk among our gods?

271
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,487
I share your appetite
for new adventure,

272
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:43,074
<i>Ragnar Lothbrok,</i>

273
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,449
and I will gladly join forces
with you,

274
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:50,665
since, as king, I am naturally not
in favor of individual enterprise

275
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,374
by my earls, or anyone else.

276
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:59,202
But, believe me, I will be happy enough
just to have my name linked with yours

277
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:03,134
when the poets tell the story
of how we norsemen sailed west

278
00:28:03,242 --> 00:28:05,303
and discovered new worlds.

279
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,709
Please, come. Eat, eat.

280
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,153
Why did you
bother to come back?

281
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:25,622
I was hungry.

282
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:27,078
Hmm.

283
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,656
How many women
have you been with?

284
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,435
- I don't suppose you know.
- I do what I want here.

285
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,138
I thought we came here
together.

286
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:44,666
We came here with Earl Ragnar.

287
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,753
I thought we came here
together and...

288
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,840
We did come here together.

289
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:52,090
We are together.

290
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,528
Why do you keep pestering me?

291
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:01,901
I am who I am

292
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,574
and I won't change,

293
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:07,418
not for you,
not for my brother,

294
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:09,585
not for anyone.

295
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:14,421
So leave if you want to.

296
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:23,122
But one day
I will be a great man

297
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:28,124
and you'll regret leaving me just
because I sleep with other women.

298
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:47,364
If you really want to be
a great man,

299
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:51,599
should you not be meeting
with King Horik now?

300
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,197
What do you mean?

301
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:56,753
Well, that's where
your brother is now,

302
00:29:59,288 --> 00:30:02,480
and no doubt he's already boasting
about how he sailed west, alone,

303
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:06,525
and all he has achieved alone.

304
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:10,293
If you weren't so stubborn
and so drunk,

305
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:13,257
you would be there too,
but you weren't invited.

306
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:16,078
You didn't even know about it.

307
00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:19,957
I could have told you.

308
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:24,169
You see, Rollo,

309
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:26,653
you need me
as much as I need you.

310
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:32,715
That is, if you really
want to be something.

311
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,342
Ragnar Lothbrok,

312
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:53,525
I drink to your good fortune.

313
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,507
May the gods continue
to favor you

314
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,710
and increase your fame.

315
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,022
May they do the same to you,
King Horik.

316
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:05,414
You have done me the honor of
pledging your fealty, as Earl, to me.

317
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:08,187
Forgive me, then,
if I seem anxious

318
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,089
to make use of your skills
and reputation...

319
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,541
As soon as possible.

320
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:19,143
To do what?

321
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,917
There is a Jarl in Gotaland,
Jarl Borg.

322
00:31:22,962 --> 00:31:26,639
He is an important fellow, but he
continues to claim he has legal rights

323
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,938
over some of my land.

324
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,283
He threatens me.

325
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,311
He nearly invaded my
territory a year ago,

326
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,758
but at the last moment
he drew back.

327
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,611
And now, once again,

328
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,483
he is making
threatening noises.

329
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:51,774
And how can I be of help
in such a matter?

330
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:58,201
Would you be prepared to travel
to Gotaland as my emissary?

331
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:01,373
I can think of no one who I
would rather represent my case,

332
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:05,115
for your fame is widespread.

333
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:07,742
If the issue is settled,

334
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:10,929
I shall be forever
in your debt.

335
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,122
<i>What do you say?</i>

336
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,258
Come.

337
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:39,171
Have you come here
of your own free will?

338
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:46,911
Yes.

339
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,586
At first, I was
suspicious of you.

340
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:55,676
I sensed something,

341
00:33:55,752 --> 00:33:58,770
so I spoke to Lord Ragnar.

342
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,767
He told me your story:

343
00:34:02,528 --> 00:34:04,897
That you were a priest,

344
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:07,629
that you were a Christian,

345
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,790
and worshipped a God
called Jesus Christ.

346
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:13,053
Is that true?

347
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,827
Yes.

348
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:19,500
And do you still worship
this God?

349
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:22,645
Are you still, in your heart,
a Christian?

350
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:25,139
No.

351
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,508
Say again.

352
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,632
No.

353
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:36,907
And a third time...

354
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,704
say it.

355
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:46,789
No.

356
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:57,386
You know why you're here,
don't you?

357
00:34:58,985 --> 00:35:03,523
<i>You have been brought here</i>
<i>as a sacrifice to the gods.</i>

358
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:20,170
Athelstan:

359
00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:32,193
<i>I have come to tell you</i>

360
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,977
that the sacrifice of this man
will not please the gods.

361
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,536
<i>He is neither willing</i>

362
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:43,311
<i>nor is his faith acceptable</i>
<i>to Odin.</i>

363
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:46,253
<i>His heart is corrupt.</i>

364
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:50,656
<i>He has not renounced</i>
<i>his false God.</i>

365
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:57,564
Looks like your God
finally came through for you.

366
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,086
<i>Instead,</i>

367
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:03,726
<i>one amongst you must agree</i>

368
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:07,267
<i>to take his place tomorrow</i>
<i>at the sacrifice.</i>

369
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:10,658
<i>If not, then all shall fail.</i>

370
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:17,399
<i>The gods in their anger</i>
<i>will punish everyone,</i>

371
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:22,343
<i>and withdraw their protection</i>
<i>from all of us.</i>

372
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:32,748
No, not you.

373
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:55,401
Before anyone else
can claim this honor,

374
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:02,761
I desire to be sacrificed.

375
00:37:02,938 --> 00:37:05,606
<i>For the sake of my family,</i>

376
00:37:05,643 --> 00:37:09,722
for the sake of all of you,

377
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,860
my friends.

378
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:21,434
<i>But even more, for the sake</i>
<i>of all humans in Midgard.</i>

379
00:37:22,247 --> 00:37:25,969
I trust that the gods will find
my sacrifice acceptable.

380
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:30,998
In which case,
I look forward to it joyfully.

381
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:46,321
