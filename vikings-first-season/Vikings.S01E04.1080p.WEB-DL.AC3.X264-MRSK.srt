He must return soon.

290
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,841
I gave your father my word

That I would look after
you both here.

292

You are not
looking after us.

293

We look after ourselves.

I cannot allow you to go

Your father would never

You're too young, Gyda,
to drink ale.

I want to make a sacrifice

Because he tried to rape

Is he a fair man?

Forgive me, but I think that
he likes to rule you.

And that whatever he says,

396

To take the credit

402
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:52,803
For building the boat,
for sailing west.

403
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,872
He wants to be the hero.

As long as I am Earl,

Ragnar Lothbrok
can give you nothing.

414

I, on the other hand,
can give you a great deal.

415
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,722
I could, for example,
confiscate the treasure

416
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,291
That you brought back
from England...

417
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,427
And offer you
a goodly portion of it.

418
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,399
Would you do that,

I might.

420
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,002
Depends.

421
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,804
On what would it depend?

422

434
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,857
He must be a man of ambition

As you can understand.

436

I used to have two boys
but they were killed.

437
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:05,502
So the man that I choose
to be my son-in-law

438
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:10,474
<i>Will hold a high</i>
<i>and special place,

439
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,311
As if he were my own son.

440
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,249
Thyri, say hello to Rollo.

441
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,051
