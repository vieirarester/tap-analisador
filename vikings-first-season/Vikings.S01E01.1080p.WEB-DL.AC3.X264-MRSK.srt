00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,551
<i>Ragnar!</i>

11
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,847
Come on.
Let's go home.

12
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,723
Watch.

13
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,957
What are you two doing?

14
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,827
I'm taking Bjorn
to the thing tomorrow.

15
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,766
Not yet.
He's not old enough.

16
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,635
He's twelve years old.

17
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,103
Take him next year.

18
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,605
Next year is soon enough.

19
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,875
He'll need a silk ribbon,
Lagertha.

20
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,614
You're a handsome boy.

21
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,849
Funny ears, though.

22
00:05:55,456 --> 00:06:00,826
<i>Don't sleep with lots of women
in kattegat.</i>

23
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,061
I can do without it
for a few days.

24
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,933
Is that another way
of saying you love me?

25
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,003
Huh?

26
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,706
I always dream of you.

27
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:20,879
I dreamt you were feeding me
blood pudding.

28
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,483
What does that mean?

29
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,085
It means you're giving me
your heart.

30
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,031
<i>get your dog, boy.</i>

31
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,968
<i>Frodi! Come on, boy.</i>

32
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:02,554
<i>The earl will deal
with some criminal offenses</i>

33
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,458
<i>And then, we'll discuss
the summer raids.</i>

34
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,460
And where will you go?

35
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,495
The earl decides.

36
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,997
He owns the ships.

37
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,867
He'll send us to the east,

38
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,104
As always, to the baltic lands.

39
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,072
But I want to know
what is to the west -

40
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,142
What cities and gods
are over there.

41
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:28,013
See, I'm not satisfied...
With this.

42
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,122
Odin gave his eye
to acquire knowledge,

43
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,860
But I would give far more.

44
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,067
And will earl haraldson
let you?

45
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,073
<i>Good.</i>

46
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,143
Like this, nice and tight...

47
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,681
<i>And on three.</i>

48
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,016
<i>One, two, three.</i>

49
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,954
Very good, Gyda.

50
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,161
Gyda, feed the goats.

51
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,965
Go on!

52
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,204
We know you're all alone here.

53
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,039
All the men are gone.

54
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,611
If you're thirsty,
I will give you a drink.

55
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,913
If you're hungry,
I will feed you.

56
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,249
Otherwise, you must go.

57
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,953
After we've satisfied
our other needs.

58
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,934
<i>I don't want to kill you,
woman.</i>

59
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,935
You couldn't kill me

60
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,704
If you tried
for a hundred years.

61
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,591
Out!

62
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,769
<i>I went to confess
my love to her</i>

63
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,837
<i>But I was set upon by a bear</i>

64
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,775
<i>And an enormous hound
who guarded her home.</i>

65
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,045
I killed the bear with my spear

66
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,014
And I managed
to strangle the hound

67
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,282
With my bare hands.

68
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,254
And that is how I gained
her hand in marriage.

69
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,193
Did she tell you
the same story?

70
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,862
Just about.

71
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,373
<i>Are you ready to receive
your arm ring</i>

72
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,675
And become a man?

73
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,177
Yes.

74
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,645
And what does a man do?

75
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,682
He fights.

76
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,117
<i>And...?</i>

77
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,253
He looks after his family.

78
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,090
<i>That's right.</i>

79
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,726
Could you look after
our family?

80
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,698
What do you mean?
You look after us.

81
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,300
Say I wasn't there.

82
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,939
<i>I have a big decision to make.</i>

83
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,141
It may change many things.

84
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,878
<i>Now, go to sleep.</i>

85
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,314
You have a big day tomorrow.

86
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,802
Bjorn!

87
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,807
So, here you are, brother.

88
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,811
By frey and all the gods
how you've grown.

89
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,046
Hello, Rollo.

90
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,481
Are you here for the thing?

91
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,883
You're a real man now.

92
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,485
Come, let's get a drink.

93
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,829
Looking a little pale, Bjorn.

94
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,834
Why don't you go
lie down?

95
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,777
So where do you think the earl
is going to send us this year?

96
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,779
Those bastards to the east

97
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,846
Are as poor as we are.

98
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,148
I know.

99
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,386
That's why we should sail west.

100
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,855
I've heard such tales, Rollo.

101
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,825
Great towns, and cities,
and treasures;

102
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:17,796
Hordes of gold and silver,
and... And a new god.

103
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,798
I've heard those stories too.

104
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,833
But what does it mean?

105
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,236
We can't sail across
an open ocean.

106
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,806
I believe there's a way
to go west.

107
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,213
I have something
that will change everything.

108
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,017
What?

109
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,856
What is that?

110
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:45,924
Now just listen.

111
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,960
A while back, I met someone,

112
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,229
A wanderer.

113
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,931
He told me that it was possible

114
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:56,601
To go west, over the open sea,

115
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,036
Using this.

116
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,842
It's a sun-board.

117
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,878
It needs to sit in water.

118
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,980
Another wanderer?

119
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,951
<i>Now tell me, Ragnar,
this-this wanderer of yours,</i>

120
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,619
Has he ever sailed
west himself?

121
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,588
Just get some water.

122
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,104
<i>Now, this candle is the sun.</i>

123
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,973
Every day...

124
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:38,142
The sun rises up into the sky
until noon.

125
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,310
See how the shadow shortens?

126
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,114
<i>At noon, it is at its shortest.</i>

127
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,016
That only tells me
how far south I have travelled.

128
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,385
Didn't I just tell you
to listen?!

129
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:53,057
<i>You mark a circle around
the pointer</i>

130
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,895
Where the shadow
is at its shortest at noon.

131
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,329
The next day at sea,

132
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,099
You place the board
back into water around noon

133
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,166
And watch the shadow.

134
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,938
<i>If the shadow only touches
the circle...</i>

135
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,373
Your course remains true?

136
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,041
Yes.

137
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:14,012
And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...

138
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,080
Then you have drifted

139
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,949
And you must steer
further south.

140
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,018
Yes.

141
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,921
And what if it never
reaches the circle?

142
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:23,988
<i>Then you are too far south</i>

143
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,156
And must steer more
to the north.

144
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,658
That's it!

145
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,995
Keep the noon shadow
on the circle

146
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,164
And your course will be true,

147
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,232
West.

148
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,107
But what if there is
no sun?

149
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,109
How can the board
help you then?

150
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,112
How could you find your way?

151
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,184
Using this.

152
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,290
Follow me outside.

153
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,131
They call it a sun-stone.

154
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,270
You see?

155
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,173
There is the sun.

156
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,108
Now we go west.

157
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,315
Come on.
come on.

158
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,232
<i>Silence!</i>

159
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,067
Silence!

160
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,589
<i>Olaf Anwend.</i>

161
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:08,326
You have pleaded guilty
to the charge of stealing.

162
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,629
<i>Tomorrow, you will run
a gauntlet of stones and turf</i>

163
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,131
As punishment.

164
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,168
Yes, lord.
Thank you, lord.

165
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,137
<i>Let it be known
a fine is to be paid</i>

166
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,340
By anyone who fails
to throw something.

167
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,213
<i>Bring in the next accused.</i>

168
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,183
- There he is!
- Murderer!

169
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,188
Eric Trygvasson,

170
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,458
You are accused of the murder
of sigvald strut

171
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,692
This January.

172
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,730
<i>It wasn't murder, lord.</i>

173
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,498
I killed him
in self-defense.

174
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,234
<i>liar!</i>

175
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:56,107
To the first person
that you met afterwards,

176
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,209
<i>As the law obliges?</i>

177
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,312
In fact, you passed by
several houses

178
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,215
Before you reported it.

179
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,384
I thought the relatives
of the dead man

180
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,652
Might be living in them.

181
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,357
<i>The law allows you
to pass two houses</i>

182
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,426
In such circumstances,

183
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,197
You murdered my brother
in cold blood!

184
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,265
It's not true!

185
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,568
We argued about
some disputed land.

186
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,572
You wanted that land
for yourself!

187
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,541
<i>You're a liar and a coward.</i>

188
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,411
- Who says I'm a coward?
- I'm not a coward!

189
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,214
Silence!

190
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,585
<i>As the normal procedures
were not followed,</i>

191
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:43,821
This killing cannot be
atoned for

192
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,524
By compensating
the victim's family.

193
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,595
Murder is a dishonorable deed
amongst our people.

194
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:54,599
Carried out in secret,
unacknowledged,

195
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,267
And likely to give rise

196
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,503
To a series of revenge killings

197
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:00,838
That would involve
your own family.

198
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,642
Lord, you knew about that land.

199
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,811
<i>You knew I had a claim
to it-</i>

200
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,279
Enough!

201
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,383
<i>I ask you to look
to the accused.</i>

202
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,487
If you think that he is guilty,

203
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,855
Raise your arms.

204
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,437
The decision must be unanimous.

205
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,950
Eric Trygvasson,

206
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,587
<i>You have been found guilty
of murder.</i>

207
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,389
Yes! Justice!

208
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,525
How do you wish to die?

209
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,396
By beheading, lord.

210
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,532
Your wish is granted.

211
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,368
You shall be executed tomorrow.

212
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,873
After which we will shall feast
and talk about the summer raids.

213
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,794
You have to.

214
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,637
Yeah! Yeah!

215
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:13,604
<i>Why is he smiling, father?</i>

216
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,575
He wants to die well,
without fear,

217
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,844
<i>To atone for his sins.</i>

218
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,922
You must watch, for his sake.

219
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,661
<i>It's his only hope
of reaching valhalla.</i>

220
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,678
Feed him to your pigs!

221
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,716
And I curse him.

222
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,752
May he never enter valhalla.

223
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,922
May he never feast
with the gods.

224
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,929
Why did he do that?

225
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:14,765
He should not have
done that.

226
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,101
<i>Someone told me
he wanted that land for himself</i>

227
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,769
And he knew Trygvasson
had the best claim to it,

228
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,671
But refused to sell it.

229
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,742
You hear that, boy?

230
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,844
This how things are done
around here.

231
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,718
<i>Olaf, son of Ingolf,</i>

232
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,686
<i>Bjorn, son of Ragnar.</i>

233
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,957
May you accept this gift
of salt and earth

234
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:46,664
That you belong to both
the land and the sea.

235
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,641
These arm rings bind you
in loyalty to me,

236
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,810
Your lord, your chieftain.

237
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,013
<i>Any oath that you swear
on these rings</i>

238
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,716
<i>Must be honored and kept.</i>

239
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,418
<i>Do you understand
and swear to this?</i>

240
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,453
Yes, lord.

241
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,422
And do you freely
give your fealty to me,

242
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,090
Your lord, your chieftain?

243
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,825
Yes, lord.

244
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,429
Good.

245
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,731
You may put on the arm rings.

246
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,140
Come here.

247
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,557
<i>Wooooo!</i>

248
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,901
let us feast!

249
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,135
My lord,

250
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,605
<i>We all want to feast,</i>

251
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,107
But we also want to know

252
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,608
Where we will be raiding
this summer.

253
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,144
Can't it wait, Ragnar?

254
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,114
<i>No. Tell us.</i>

255
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,516
We want to know.

256
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,185
We have a right to know.

257
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,953
<i>Very well.</i>

258
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,623
<i>We will raid east again,
to the eastlands,</i>

259
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,624
And into Russia.

260
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,627
Every year

261
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,830
We go to the same places!

262
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,135
But there is an alternative...

263
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,939
If you choose.

264
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,846
- Yes, yes.
- Choice, yes.

265
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:45,649
I have heard of these rumors,
these stories;

266
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,618
That if we travel west,

267
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,220
<i>That we will somehow
reach a land</i>

268
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,589
<i>That is rich and plentiful.</i>

269
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,027
But I tell you that
I will not risk my ships

270
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,229
Or my reputation

271
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,632
On such a deluded fantasy.

272
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,237
They are my ships -
I pay for them -

273
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:09,240
And they go where
I tell them to go.

274
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:12,142
Now that's the end
of the matter.

275
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,748
Let's feast!

276
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,198
<i>Let me see!</i>

277
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,768
<i>It's a fine ring.</i>

278
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,576
Ragnar Lothbrok,

279
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,046
<i>Earl Haraldson wants to
speak with you -</i>

280
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,114
In private.

281
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,052
<i>Stay with your uncle.</i>

282
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,332
Ragnar Lothbrok...

283
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,837
Sit down.

284
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,579
Are you hungry?

285
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,181
Yes, lord.

286
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,789
You want to feast in my hall?

287
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,124
You want to sail in my ships?

288
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,260
Anything else you want from me?

289
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,132
You keep talking about
the west -

290
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,101
What do you know of it?

291
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:48,138
That it's a land
of great riches?

292
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,309
<i>I can't be sure.</i>

293
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,310
But I believe that-

294
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,680
I don't care what you believe.

295
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:59,350
You insulted me out there,

296
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:02,319
And not for the first time,

297
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:06,657
But, believe me,
it will be the last.

298
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,667
<i>Who told you you could go?</i>

299
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,907
You are a farmer.

300
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,179
You should be content
with your lot.

301
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,984
Farms are few
and in great demand,

302
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,388
And there are many people here

303
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,191
Who would like to possess
your land.

304
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,262
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

305
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,232
I understand.

306
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,737
Then don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

307
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,454
I don't trust him.
Watch him.

308
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,370
<i>Where are they?</i>

309
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,072
Where are my sons?

310
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,374
You said you'd found them.

311
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,055
<i>Where are we going now?
I'm so tired.</i>

312
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:21,325
<i>To talk to the gods.</i>

313
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,793
It's what we do.

314
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,840
- Why don't you come in?
- I'm waiting.

315
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,014
Sit.

316
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,122
What do you want?

317
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,959
I want to know
what the gods have in store.

318
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,227
<i>For you...</i>

319
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,996
Or for the boy?

320
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,900
I'm more interested in myself.

321
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,804
The gods desire you
to have a great future.

322
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,038
I see that.

323
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,175
But they can withdraw
their goodwill

324
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,242
At any time.

325
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,014
<i>To have this great future,</i>

326
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,249
Must I challenge the law?

327
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:24,221
You must convince the gods
to alter the runes

328
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,825
So they work in your favor.

329
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,461
But the laws of men

330
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,933
Are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

331
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,039
So I should take
the laws of men

332
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,241
Into my own hands?

333
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,613
Answer me.

334
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,249
You already have your answer.

335
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,317
No I don't.

336
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,922
<i>Well, then go
and ask the gods yourself.</i>

337
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,924
What are you afraid of?

338
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,100
<i>Wait outside.</i>

339
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,569
<i>All right.</i>

340
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,639
You haven't helped me at all,
ancient one.

341
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,079
Perhaps you asked
the wrong questions.

342
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,134
We have someone special
to visit.

343
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,336
His name is floki.

344
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,905
<i>Floki?</i>

345
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,406
Like loki the god?

346
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,076
Yes, only different.

347
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,179
How is he different?

348
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,648
He's not a god.

349
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,184
Why didn't he come
to the thing?

350
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,086
Because...

351
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,222
Because he's shy.

352
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,497
<i>Floki,</i>

353
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,933
This is my son, Bjorn.

354
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,167
<i>Hello.</i>

355
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,969
How are you?

356
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,171
Well. Thank you, sir.

357
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,707
Let me see.

358
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,180
You have your father's eyes...

359
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,015
Unfortunately.

360
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,985
Why unfortunately?

361
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,187
It means he will be like you,

362
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,023
And therefore he will want
to do better than you,

363
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,458
And you will hate him for it.

364
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,965
How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

365
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,033
It's the same with trees.

366
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,536
I can tell which trees
will make the best planks

367
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:55,038
Just by looking at them.

368
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,107
I can look inside the tree.

369
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,311
<i>Floki is a boat-builder...</i>

370
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,980
Among other things.

371
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,113
This is one.

372
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,317
Inside this tree are two
almost perfect planks.

373
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,020
They will bend, then curve,

374
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,021
Like a woman's body

375
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,355
From the thighs to the back.

376
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,059
When I split this tree
I will find them.

377
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,362
You can see that?

378
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,434
Do you think I'm joking?

379
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,081
I joke about many things,

380
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,083
Son of Ragnar,

381
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,452
But never about
ship-building.

382
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,457
Do you imagine ships
are just dead things?

383
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,193
<i>So... What about our boat?</i>

384
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,200
<i>It will be lighter
and carry a bigger sail.</i>

385
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,635
The construction is different.

386
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,670
It's built with
a strong central plank.

387
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,105
The two strakes above it
are nailed

388
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,706
Directly onto the knees
of the frame.

389
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,742
But the ones below -
look! -

390
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,410
Are cleated and lashed
onto the frames,

391
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,747
So they can move in relation
to each other.

392
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,483
This means the boat won't butt
against the waves like a goat,

393
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,652
But move over them
like a ripple.

394
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:52,422
<i>The hull is deeper.
How will my men set their oars?</i>

395
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,391
<i>I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,</i>

396
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,693
<i>And the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.</i>

397
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,795
And you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

398
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,365
that's why
I'm building it.

399
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:07,537
But will it be strong enough?

400
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,474
We won't know that
until we try.

401
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,544
<i>For the anchor.</i>

402
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,814
It's all I have left
from last summer's raids.

403
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,583
Don't worry.

404
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,519
We'll soon be as rich
as dwarves!

405
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,299
I missed you.

406
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,277
<i>Did anything happen
while we were away?</i>

407
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,314
No.

408
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,388
did you miss me?

409
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,296
I ached with love longing.

410
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,467
My belly was empty of laughter.

411
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,538
Is that what you want?

412
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,511
You want me to make you laugh?

413
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,614
I don't want to laugh now.

414
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,753
I want to ride you,
like a bull.

415
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,960
Like a wild bull.

416
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,590
Hello, young Bjorn.

417
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,491
Hello, Rollo.

418
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,594
Where are your parents?

419
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:12,662
They are having sex.

420
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,633
well...

421
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,805
I guess we'll have to wait.

422
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,454
So, Gyda,

423
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,857
<i>Is your mother teaching you
how to use a shield?</i>

424
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,527
Yes, I know how
to use a shield.

425
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,763
Your mother was a famous
shield-maiden.

426
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:50,700
Is a famous shield-maiden.

427
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,868
<i>Come on, children,
to bed.</i>

428
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,869
<i>Do I have to?</i>

429
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,471
Let's leave the men.

430
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,706
- But I'm a man.
- I have a ring.

431
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,575
<i>Let him stay awhile.</i>

432
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,643
To bed!

433
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,547
<i>Say good night.</i>

434
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,016
Good night, my children.

435
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,019
Good night.

436
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,287
<i>Hey!</i>

437
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,303
Tell me your news.

438
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,371
What about the boat?

439
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,307
It's nearly ready.

440
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,978
I won't go under your command.

441
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,650
I won't go
unless we're all equal.

442
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,320
<i>We are brothers.</i>

443
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,956
You and I will always be equal.

444
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,732
Then we must find a crew.

445
00:38:55,734 --> 00:39:00,670
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

446
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,672
Many will be afraid,

447
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,943
Some may even go to him
and betray us.

448
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,047
I must go piss.

449
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,016
Yesterday, I was with a girl
from the town.

450
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,451
Thank you.

451
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,454
A good-looking girl too.

452
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,764
But when she shouted out
in pleasure,

453
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,099
I didn't see her face,

454
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,870
I saw yours.

455
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,874
Lagertha...

456
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,511
Don't talk like that.

457
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,112
<i>Why not?</i>

458
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,050
I think about you all the time.

459
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,986
That's too bad.

460
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,590
Don't insult me,
shield-maiden.

461
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,792
No.

462
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,060
I would never insult you.

463
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,029
You're too great a warrior...

464
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,903
But perhaps not so great a man.

465
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,941
I saw something.

466
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,009
What did you see?

467
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,046
A sign.

468
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:29,619
It made me certain
we're doing the right thing.

469
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,894
Good night, brother.

470
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,748
Set the sail.

471
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,085
Floki! The sail!

472
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,687
She'll sink.

473
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:09,192
<i>I shouldn't have pretended
to build such a boat.</i>

474
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,694
It's beyond
my humble capabilities.

475
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,031
I'll set the sail.

476
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,966
Floki I'm sorry, Ragnar.

477
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,168
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

478
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,904
<i>Shut up, man.</i>

479
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,194
Ha!

480
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,102
Now it runs on its cool keel.

481
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,071
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

482
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,073
Why didn't you believe me?

483
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,841
I told you I could do it!

484
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:06,583
Now it's all up to you,
Ragnar Lothbrok.
