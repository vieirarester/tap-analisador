1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,209
<i>Previously on "vikings":</i>

2
00:00:04,275 --> 00:00:06,043
<i>Odin gave his eye
to acquire knowledge.</i>

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,978
<i>I would give far more.</i>

4
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:09,446
We will raid east again.

5
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:11,415
Every year we go
to the same places,

6
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:12,850
but there is an alternative.

7
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,251
They're my ships

8
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:15,486
and they go where
I tell them to go.

9
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:17,554
That's the end of the matter.

10
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,156
<i>We should sail west.</i>

11
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:20,624
Can't sail across
an open ocean.

12
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:23,494
I have something
that will change everything.

13
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:24,928
You keep talking about the west.

14
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,330
I believe...

15
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,664
I don't care what you believe.

16
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:31,120
Don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

17
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,203
The boat will be lighter
and faster than before.

18
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:35,005
Do you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

19
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:36,740
We won't know
that until we try.

20
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,308
We must find a crew.

21
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,210
Not many men will go against
the wishes of Haraldson.

22
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:43,113
<i>Some may even go to him
and betray us.</i>

33
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,795
Erik.

34
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:07,831
Ragnar Lothbrok,
welcome to my house.

35
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:09,766
You also, rollo.

36
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,735
<i>I've done as you asked, Ragnar,</i>

37
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:14,771
<i>and sought out these young men
to meet you.</i>

38
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:17,541
All of them have sworn
upon their rings

39
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,377
to keep this meeting a secret.

40
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:23,180
You have done well, my friend,

41
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,115
although I knew
I could trust you.

42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,117
What are we here for?

43
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:29,419
You are here, firstly,

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,188
because you have
nothing better to do.

45
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:36,426
See, all you lot
live idle and wasted lives.

46
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,062
Listen to him!

47
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,900
We have built a new boat.

48
00:02:43,968 --> 00:02:46,937
And with this boat,
for the first time,

49
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,205
we can go west.

50
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:53,410
Across the great sea,
to a place called England,

51
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:55,746
where countless riches await us.

52
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,848
<i>How would we
steer across the open sea?</i>

53
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:02,152
We have discovered a way.

54
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:06,056
You want us to
join you in the boat?

55
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,692
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

56
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:11,428
And I have Ragnar's word
that we will all be equal

57
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,163
and share equally
the spoils of our raid.

58
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:14,431
<i>If there are any.</i>

59
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,370
What is your name?

60
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:23,273
Knut.

61
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:25,309
I promise you, Knut,

62
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:26,777
I've heard witnesses.

63
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,712
Just stories.

64
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:30,547
Just stories...

65
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,183
<i>Just stories.</i>

66
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:40,457
All things begin and end
as stories.

67
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,626
We have to remember, though,

68
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:46,663
that Earl Haraldson
has ordered us to sail east.

69
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:49,533
The Earl knows nothing about
our new boat.

70
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:51,768
He knows nothing about
the new way of navigating.

71
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:55,205
This is why he refuses
to let us go west.

72
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,873
He could kill us for
disobeying his orders.

73
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:58,742
Yes, he could.

74
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:04,214
We can offer you a chance
to shine in battle

75
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:06,783
<i>and impress the gods,</i>

76
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:08,118
and to bring back such plunder

77
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,721
that you have never seen before.

78
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,160
Have you got the balls
to join us?

79
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:19,896
I'll go.

80
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,900
- And I.
- I will go.

81
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,337
I too! I will too!
And I! I will go!

82
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,482
What about you, Knut?

83
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,851
Are you coming?

84
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,319
Yes, I want a good story
to tell my children.

85
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:45,355
Ahh!

86
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:50,460
Prepare to leave
in the next few weeks,

87
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,130
and tell no one
that doesn't need to know.

88
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,370
<i>- Good throw.</i>

89
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,938
<i>Well played.</i>

90
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:10,847
Well?

91
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:13,383
<i>My lord, there was a meeting.</i>

92
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:14,584
Where?

93
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,420
In the house of Erik Marteinn.

94
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:20,690
Was Ragnar Lothbrok there?

95
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:22,859
Yes, lord.

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,698
Shall we show them the axe?

97
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:31,735
Nothing would please me more,
but it's too soon.

98
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,838
We need to watch and wait.

99
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,576
Only good things
come from watching...

100
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:40,310
And waiting.

101
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,201
Were you looking at my wife?

102
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:07,237
Have you slept with her?

103
00:06:07,305 --> 00:06:08,605
No, lord!

104
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:11,141
I swear on all the gods.

105
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:17,614
If she wants to sleep with you,

106
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:19,382
then I give my permission.

107
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,020
It will be arranged.

108
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,848
<i>So when do we sail?</i>

109
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,850
I already told you.

110
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:55,552
I don't want you to come.

111
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:56,353
Why not?

112
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:02,492
I need to leave the children and
the farm in the hands of someone I trust.

113
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:05,662
What if the Earl finds out we
have gone without his permission?

114
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:09,499
He might try and claim
our family home.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,101
This was going to be
the most exciting voyage

116
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,936
of our lives.

117
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:14,905
To go west!

118
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:24,681
I have dreamed of it
many times,

119
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:27,717
and in my dreams
we are always together.

120
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,689
What if there is no west?

121
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:38,795
This is the most dangerous
and stupid voyage ever.

122
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:43,466
What if we both die, hmm?

123
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:46,303
Then who would take care
of the children...

124
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:49,306
rollo?!

125
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,876
You have no right to say that!

126
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,152
All right, all right. You go.

127
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,224
<i>You go</i>

128
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:11,895
and I shall stay here
and look after the children.

129
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,301
Siggy?

130
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:19,069
Go away!

131
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:26,676
It's so cold in here,

132
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:30,146
but we'll be warm soon enough.

133
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,195
What do you take me for?

134
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:46,796
Did you really suppose
that a worm like you

135
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:48,365
could sleep with a woman
like me?

136
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:49,199
I'm an Earl's wife!

137
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,579
<i>Now I know who to trust</i>

138
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:03,913
and who not to trust.

139
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:10,687
<i>- Take him.
- Yes, lord.</i>

140
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:14,157
<i>Get rid of him.</i>

141
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:15,525
<i>Come.</i>

142
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,459
<i>Outside.</i>

143
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:07,844
Ungh!

144
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:11,247
<i>Get up!</i>

145
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:17,053
My love!

146
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,888
Never mind that.
Defend yourself.

147
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:23,293
How dare you?

148
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:24,427
Am I not good enough for you?

149
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:29,599
Am I not strong enough for you?

150
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,136
Ungh!

151
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:34,304
Ungh!

152
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:39,609
Now listen...

153
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,113
- You listen.
- Ungh!

154
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:49,486
Don't you remember?
I saved your life.

155
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:56,459
Ragnar how could I forget?

156
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,761
You keep reminding me.

157
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:07,270
Ungh!

158
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,907
I'm so angry with you!

159
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:13,743
Stop!

160
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,247
Are you mad?

161
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:18,748
You could have killed
each other!

162
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,283
Is that what you want?

163
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:21,851
We were just
having an argument.

164
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,454
Well, never argue
like that again.

165
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:25,655
Go on then!

166
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:26,389
Back to bed!

167
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:40,069
<i>It's a fine thing</i>

168
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:43,573
when the little pig teaches
the boar a lesson.

169
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:44,541
Ungh!

170
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:01,157
Olafur surprised me.

171
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:03,726
I didn't think, out of all of
them, he would behave like that.

172
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,730
A man lives or dies
by his honor.

173
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:08,865
<i>That's true.</i>

174
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:11,267
He thought so little of mine

175
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:15,104
that he really believed
that I would give you to him.

176
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,975
Honor is a rare commodity
these days.

177
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,211
Yes.

178
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:24,814
Almost as rare as those
in whom I can trust.

179
00:12:25,406 --> 00:12:26,776
It's true, my love,

180
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:29,045
our enemies are everywhere.

181
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,591
Everywhere?

182
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:41,893
They cannot prevail.

183
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,242
They cannot prevail.

184
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:06,029
Rollo.

185
00:13:20,344 --> 00:13:22,412
Where is my anchor?

186
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,048
It was promised for today.

187
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,250
Maybe your blacksmith
is a liar.

188
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:28,718
I don't think so.

189
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:33,523
This hair is from
his daughter's head.

190
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:34,925
I promised him

191
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,860
that if he went
to Earl Haraldson

192
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:39,096
I would find a way to kill her.

193
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,806
I still don't see Knut.

194
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:52,509
Well, that's because
he isn't here.

195
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,711
He hasn't sent word either.

196
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,916
That troubles me.

197
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:01,384
We live in a sea of troubles.

198
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:05,889
But look, some are ended.

199
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:15,732
Here, this is yours.

200
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,733
And this is mine.

201
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:38,555
Master.

202
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:10,587
<i>May the gods bless us</i>

203
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:12,522
<i>with powerful winds
and calm seas.</i>

204
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:01,771
Come here, slave.

205
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,278
<i>Leif, cover the ravens.</i>

206
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:46,182
<i>Feel that wind;
That breeze is up.</i>

207
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:53,188
<i>Ready the oars!</i>

208
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:46,542
<i>Come.</i>

209
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:51,181
Well?

210
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,084
They have set sail.

211
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:55,785
Good.

212
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:57,187
They'll never be
heard from again.

213
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:58,021
But...

214
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:00,657
But what?

215
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,795
What if Ragnar is right?

216
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:07,764
There are no lands to the west!

217
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,937
Get out.

218
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:21,578
It's noon.

219
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,047
Let's look at the board.

220
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,482
Get the bucket.

221
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:48,738
<i>Not too far South.</i>

222
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,741
Nor too far north.

223
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:56,846
The board works.

224
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:00,116
How do we know?

225
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,361
<i>The great sea is
held in place by Jormungand,</i>

226
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,029
<i>the serpent,</i>

227
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,099
whose giant body encircles it

228
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,901
and who keeps his tail
in his mouth

229
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,170
<i>to complete the circle</i>

230
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:21,971
<i>and stop the waves
breaking loose.</i>

231
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,945
<i>But one day, the God Thor,
son of earth,</i>

232
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,281
<i>was fishing in the sea
for the serpent,</i>

233
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:33,416
<i>using a bull's head for bait.</i>

234
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:37,287
<i>Jormungand reared up</i>

235
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,355
<i>and the waves pummeled
the shore</i>

236
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:42,392
<i>as he twisted and writhed
in a fury.</i>

237
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:48,731
<i>They were well matched,
serpent and God,</i>

238
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,600
<i>in that furious fight.</i>

239
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:56,306
<i>The seas boiled around them,</i>

240
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:01,678
<i>but then the hook
became dislodged,</i>

241
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,613
and the serpent slithered free

242
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:08,785
<i>and sank again, so quickly,
beneath the waves.</i>

243
00:20:12,122 --> 00:20:14,757
<i>And soon, the sea was calm
once more,</i>

244
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:18,428
<i>as if nothing had disturbed it.</i>

245
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:33,690
Thor.

246
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:39,396
Storm's coming.

247
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:41,164
Should we let down the sail?

248
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:45,836
Floki, should we let down
the sail?

249
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,604
Yes, we have to take
the sail down,

250
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,707
and then we must row.

251
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,476
If we are not moving forward,

252
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:54,478
then we will be soaked
by the waves and sink.

253
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,712
<i>Ready?</i>

254
00:20:55,813 --> 00:20:56,580
<i>Keep her straight!</i>

255
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:57,981
You heard him!

256
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:11,862
Tent!

257
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:26,209
Shove the oars!

258
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,211
Row!

259
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:29,079
Row!

260
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,037
Are you afraid?

261
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,506
Floki yes, Ragnar
Lothbrok, I am afraid.

262
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:32,976
But not for me.

263
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:35,979
I am afraid for my boat.

264
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:45,222
Thor is striking his anvil.

265
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,223
He is angry with us.

266
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:48,892
He wants to sink us.

267
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,005
It's true!

268
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,040
Thor is beating his hammer.

269
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:08,545
The lightning is the sparks
from his anvil.

270
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,914
But he's not angry with us.

271
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,649
I understand now.

272
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,352
Why should he be angry with us?

273
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:18,722
Why should he want to sink
our boat?

274
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:21,625
Don't you understand?
He is celebrating.

275
00:23:21,726 --> 00:23:24,694
He is full of good news.

276
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:28,298
<i>He wants to show everybody
that he can't sink this boat.</i>

277
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,933
<i>He loves this boat!</i>

278
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,935
<i>Sit down, you idiot!</i>

279
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,637
It's my boat,
and the gods love my boat.

280
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,207
Why should I...

281
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:38,175
<i>Not be happy?!</i>

282
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:41,178
Floki, sit down.

283
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:45,615
Remember, you can't swim!

284
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,107
Father Cuthbert!

285
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:48,511
What is it, brother Athelstan?

286
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,513
We can all see the signs.

287
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,482
Signs? What signs?
Of what do you speak?

288
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,883
You know as well as we

289
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:56,086
that judgment day is at hand.

290
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,921
Jeremiah says so!

291
00:24:58,022 --> 00:25:00,023
"And on that day,
the sun shall be darkened,"

292
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,691
and the moon shall
not give her light,

293
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,360
"and the stars of heaven
shall fall."

294
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,095
In the name of God,
that is enough.

295
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,564
But it's true!

296
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:09,699
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea,"

297
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,735
and saw a beast rise up
out of the sea,

298
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:13,970
"having seven heads
and ten horns."

299
00:25:14,071 --> 00:25:15,472
I will hear no more!

300
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:17,774
<i>You will return
to your dormitory</i>

301
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,277
and pray to God for forgiveness
and humility...

302
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:21,745
And when the storm has passed

303
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,880
all shall be well.

304
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,348
You will do as I order.

305
00:25:29,287 --> 00:25:30,420
Yes, father.

306
00:25:50,608 --> 00:25:52,108
Father!

307
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,014
Good day to you, blacksmith.

308
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,654
My lord, how
can I be of use to you?

309
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:07,657
You make anchors, don't you?

310
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:11,494
Yes, lord.

311
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:13,196
Have you made any recently?

312
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:20,403
No, not recently,
lord Haraldson.

313
00:26:20,504 --> 00:26:21,671
<i>You didn't forge an anchor</i>

314
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:23,606
for a man called
Ragnar Lothbrok?

315
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:28,778
I would have remembered.

316
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,450
Don't hurt my daughter.

317
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,786
Why would I hurt your daughter?

318
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,689
<i>His lordship just wants
to know the truth.</i>

319
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,026
Did you forge the anchor
for Ragnar Lothbrok's ship?

320
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,735
Yes, I forged it.

321
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,371
Let go of her.

322
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,776
Put down your hammer.

323
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:02,379
I promise you no harm
will come to your daughter.

324
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:15,892
Look in the flames.

325
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:23,400
<i>The sages say that
we can see our future</i>

326
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:27,103
in the flames.

327
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:41,050
<i>No!</i>

328
00:27:41,152 --> 00:27:42,419
<i>Please, no!</i>

329
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,720
What do you see?

330
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:44,754
I see my own death.

331
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:49,459
<i>No! No!</i>

332
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,427
<i>Noooooooo!</i>

333
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:36,439
There is no west!

334
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:49,052
We are not sailing towards
any new country

335
00:28:49,153 --> 00:28:50,854
but just into an empty ocean...

336
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,527
Utterly and completely lost.

337
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,832
<i>Kauko, leif...</i>

338
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:05,602
We have been persuaded
by madmen and fools.

339
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,773
The God loki
is behind this voyage.

340
00:29:13,077 --> 00:29:14,611
<i>That scoundrel, that sly one.</i>

341
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:18,381
<i>Trouble and suffering are meat
and drink to him.</i>

342
00:29:18,482 --> 00:29:19,482
Shut up, man!

343
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,149
No!

344
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,685
No.

345
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:25,255
If anyone is mad, it is you.

346
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,092
I'm not the one who convinced
all these good men

347
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:31,828
to sacrifice their lives
for a dream,

348
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:34,163
<i>an illusion.</i>

349
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:36,466
<i>It wasn't me who joined forces
with the sly one</i>

350
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,834
to get us to sail west,

351
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:41,638
into nothing, into nowhere.

352
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:42,839
<i>He's mad!</i>

353
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,040
<i>Don't tempt the gods!</i>

354
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:45,675
Oh, and here we are, lost,

355
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:48,578
<i>certain to die.</i>

356
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,648
For what?

357
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,483
Sit down and shut up.

358
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:57,320
You sound like the sly one.

359
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,122
<i>Perhaps you are
the God of mischief</i>

360
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:00,957
<i>who sends men mad,
and sends them to their deaths.</i>

361
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:02,559
<i>Sit down!</i>

362
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,794
<i>I curse the day I ever agreed
to come with you,</i>

363
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:06,329
<i>Ragnar Lothbrok.</i>

364
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,665
For this ship is cursed,
and we are...

365
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,884
Release the ravens.

366
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,848
If the birds do not return,
there is land.

367
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:51,534
<i>But if they do...</i>

368
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,263
They've come back.

369
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:16,000
There's no land.

370
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,206
Seabirds!

371
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:22,640
Seagulls!

372
00:31:22,741 --> 00:31:23,441
Seagulls!

373
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:27,145
<i>Listen!</i>

374
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:29,747
Woo!

375
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:37,288
- It works! Yeah!
- We made it!

376
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,758
Row! We made it!

377
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,327
<i>Row!</i>

378
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:43,828
Ragnar, you did it!

379
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:40,218
<i>Tie the sail!</i>

380
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:44,756
<i>Oars! Drop the oars!</i>

381
00:32:58,037 --> 00:32:59,304
What is it?

382
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,272
Why was the warning bell rung?

383
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:03,007
They've come. They are here.

384
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,876
Who is here?

385
00:33:04,977 --> 00:33:07,946
Hell - and all its devils!

386
00:33:08,047 --> 00:33:10,448
Lock the doors and stay inside,

387
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:11,549
all of you! Hurry.

388
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:28,900
<i>They know we're here.</i>

389
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,269
No one throw their lives away
unnecessarily,

390
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,005
even to impress the gods.

391
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:36,007
Stay close.

392
00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:54,492
There are here!
Come, brother!

393
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:55,226
Ahh! Quick!

394
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:29,661
<i>Arne, get to work.</i>

395
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:41,673
Father Cuthbert
don't be afraid.

396
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:43,207
Trust in God,

397
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:45,677
and let us pray.

398
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:49,407
In nomine patris
et fili et spiritus sancti.

399
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:52,110
Pater noster qui es in caelis.

400
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:53,144
Pater noster qui-agggghhhhhh!

401
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:57,815
This is the end!

402
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:58,783
The son of man cometh!

403
00:36:06,392 --> 00:36:07,125
Aghhhhh!

404
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:12,897
Leif.

405
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,373
Ungh!

406
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:27,445
Ungh!

407
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:47,732
Ugh!

408
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:01,979
Ungh! Ungh!

409
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:24,335
<i>I don't understand.</i>

410
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:27,271
Why do they leave such
treasures unprotected?

411
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,608
Is there some spell,
some magic which protects them?

412
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:33,344
It appears not.

413
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,150
<i>Perhaps they think
their God protects them.</i>

414
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:41,919
If this is their God,
then he's dead.

415
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,988
<i>He is nailed to a cross.</i>

416
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,389
<i>He cannot protect anyone.</i>

417
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:48,326
He is not alive, like Odin,
Thor or Frey.

418
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:49,727
What use is he then?

419
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:07,345
Don't kill me.

420
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:11,147
<i>You speak our language.</i>

421
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:15,486
How do you speak our language?

422
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,889
I've travelled.

423
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,491
We are told to travel,
to take the word of God.

424
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,785
Please, don't kill me.

425
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:41,541
<i>What is that
you have in your hand?</i>

426
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:43,877
A book...

427
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:46,680
The gospels of st John,
I... I wanted to save it.

428
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:56,405
<i>Of all the treasures
I see in this place,</i>

429
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,529
you chose to save this?

430
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:01,308
Yes.

431
00:39:02,438 --> 00:39:05,546
Hmm. Why?

432
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:13,042
Why?

433
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:17,644
Because without the word of God

434
00:39:17,745 --> 00:39:19,613
there is only darkness.

435
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,038
This is a strange place indeed.

436
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:37,874
We have been everywhere
and we have found no women.

437
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:42,002
Just these strange men.

438
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,305
I believe they are
the priests of their God.

439
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:46,840
<i>Take what you will.</i>

440
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:49,143
This is what we came for.

441
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:53,880
Why have you not killed
this one?

442
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:56,149
He is worth more alive...

443
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,717
to sell as a slave.

444
00:39:57,818 --> 00:39:59,319
I would kill him.

445
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,755
We have no room left
on the boat.

446
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:04,391
I forbid it.

447
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:05,926
How can you forbid
it, little brother?

448
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:08,662
We are all equals,

449
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,184
and I say he dies.

450
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:18,471
Does it really mean
that much to you, brother?

451
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,757
This is what we care
for your God.

452
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:16,455
<i>So much gold!</i>

453
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:17,290
Look!

454
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,693
Keep them moving!

455
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:24,163
Ugh!

456
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:42,791
